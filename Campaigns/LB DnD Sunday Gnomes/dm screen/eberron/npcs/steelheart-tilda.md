# Tilda Steelheart

## Background and Personality

Tilda Steelheart was born and raised in the dwarven city of Kundarak in the Mror Holds. Her family was part of the powerful Steelheart clan, known for their expert craftsmanship in weapons and armor. Tilda learned the art of blacksmithing from her father at a young age and quickly became a skilled apprentice.

As Tilda grew older, she became more and more fascinated by the stories of adventurers who came through Kundarak. She dreamed of leaving the safety of the city walls and experiencing the thrill of exploring the world beyond. Despite her family's objections, Tilda eventually left Kundarak and set out on her own.

Tilda's travels eventually brought her to Sharn, where she found work as a blacksmith. She quickly made a name for herself among the adventurers and mercenaries who passed through the city, crafting custom weapons and armor for those in need. Tilda is proud of her dwarven heritage and often wears traditional dwarven clothing, including a bright red vest and a wide-brimmed hat. She has a fiery personality to match her red hair and is not afraid to speak her mind.

## Ropeplaying Tilda

Tilda Steelheart is a skilled blacksmith and craftsman with a fiery personality. She takes pride in her work and can be quite passionate about her craft. She is very protective of her creations and doesn't take kindly to those who disrespect or damage them. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for those who appreciate her work and can be quite generous with her time and resources. She has a good sense of humor and enjoys a good joke or prank, especially if it involves her fellow shopkeeper, Drogan. However, she can also be quite stubborn and set in her ways, which can lead to conflicts with others. As a DM, you could roleplay Tilda as a colorful character who provides valuable information and items to the players, but who can also be a source of potential conflict or comic relief.

    "You know, they say dwarves have a natural resistance to poison, but I'm pretty sure Drogan just drinks so much ale he's built up an immunity."

    "I once challenged Drogan to a drinking contest. Let's just say it didn't end well for me, but at least I got to see him do a perfect headstand on the tavern table."
