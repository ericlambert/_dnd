# Drogan Stormhelm

## Background and personality

Drogan Stormhelm was born in the Mror Holds, a rugged and mountainous region in the eastern part of Khorvaire known for its dwarven clans and rich deposits of precious metals. Drogan grew up in a family of soldiers, and from an early age, he showed a natural aptitude for combat. When he was old enough, Drogan enlisted in the Mror military and served with distinction for several years, rising through the ranks to become a sergeant in one of the elite mountain divisions.

During his time in the military, Drogan saw action in several conflicts, including the dwarves' long-standing feud with the goblinoids of the nearby Demon Wastes. Despite the hardships of military life, Drogan loved the camaraderie and sense of purpose that came with serving in the army. However, after a particularly brutal battle against a horde of hobgoblins, Drogan began to question whether a life of constant warfare was what he truly wanted.

Eventually, Drogan left the military and set out to find a new path for himself. He spent several years wandering the continent, taking odd jobs and getting into the occasional scrap. Eventually, he found himself drawn to the city of Sharn, where he hoped to start a new life and leave his violent past behind him. When asked why he came to Sharn, Drogan simply replies that he was looking for a fresh start and a chance to make something of himself in the big city.

## Roleplaying Drogan

Drogan would likely greet customers warmly as they enter The Storm's Forge. He might say something like, "Welcome, friend! What can I do for you today?" or "Good day to you! Is there something specific you're looking for?" His military background may give him a no-nonsense demeanor at times, but he understands the importance of customer service and would want to make sure everyone feels welcome in his shop.

As a DM, you could roleplay Drogan as a gruff, no-nonsense individual who is fiercely loyal to his friends and colleagues. He is a skilled fighter with a background in military tactics and is always thinking one step ahead. However, he can be slow to trust outsiders and may initially be suspicious of the party's motives. He values honor and integrity and expects the same from those around him. Despite his tough exterior, Drogan has a soft spot for those in need and will go out of his way to help others if he deems it necessary.
