# Smelt

## Background

Smelt was once a soldier in the Last War, serving under the banner of Karnath in a unit dedicated to defending the nation's borders from invaders. Of the Five Nations that participated in the war, Karnath was known for its use of necromancy and undead soldiers in battle, not warforged so Smelt's service for Karnath is unusual.

Karnath is ruled by a monarchy and has a society that values strength, discipline, and loyalty above all else. Despite its reputation as a dark and dangerous place, Karnath is also home to a number of skilled artisans and craftsmen, and is renowned for its blacksmithing and metallurgy. Smelt's time as a soldier in Karnath had a profound impact on her and shaped her worldview in many ways.

Most of her time in the army was uneventful and away from the front but not all of it. She witnessed firsthand the horrors of war and the toll it took on her fellow soldiers, both living and constructed.

During her time as a soldier, Smelt developed a strong sense of duty and loyalty to her comrades-in-arms. However, she also witnessed the devastating effects of war on both soldiers and civilians, leading her to question the nature and purpose of conflict. Ultimately, these experiences shaped her desire to create a safe haven for her fellow warforged, where they could find camaraderie and joy without the threat of violence or discrimination.

After the war, Smelt found herself without a purpose and struggling to adapt to a world at peace. In search of meaning, Smelt traveled to Sharn. She found that many warforged were struggling to find acceptance and belonging in the city, despite the end of the war. Smelt saw an opportunity to create a safe and welcoming space for her fellow constructs, a place where they could come together and socialize without fear of discrimination or persecution.

And so, she opened the Cog Carnival, a small tavern tucked away in a corner of the High Walls neighborhood of the Lower Tavick's Landing district. Despite her limited resources, Smelt spared no expense in creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, complete with games and entertainment for her patrons. She couldn't afford the city's expensive gambling license, but she found a way to make the Cog Carnival a place where warforged could play games for free and let loose after a hard day's work.

Smelt takes great pride in her establishment, and she often spends her days working behind the bar or chatting with her patrons. Her time in the military has made her a natural leader, and she takes it upon herself to ensure that her fellow warforged are taken care of and have a place to call their own. Despite the challenges she faces as a warforged in a largely human-dominated city, Smelt remains steadfast in her mission to create a safe and welcoming community for her kind.
