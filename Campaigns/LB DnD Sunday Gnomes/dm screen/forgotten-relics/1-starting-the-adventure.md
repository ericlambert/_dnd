# Starting the Adventure

## Arrival

> Arriving at Sharn's docking station atop Lyrandar Tower, you take in the stunning view of the city sprawling out before you. For some of you this view may be totally new, for others a distant memory. Some of you may see it every day. However for all of you, when you pause to do it, taking in the city of Sharn is a stunning experience. Its towering spires, flying airships, and intricate network of bridges and walkways make for a breathtaking sight.
>
> -------------------
> As you make your way through the docking area of Lyrandar Tower, you can't help but be awed by the sheer size of the structure.
>
> The walls and floors are made of polished stone, and the ceilings are adorned with intricate carvings and shimmering crystal chandeliers. You catch glimpses of House Lyrandar's impressive airships through the windows, floating like leviathans in the sky.
>
> -------------------
> You find yourself immersed in a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and sounds.
>
> As you walk, you see all manner of people from all walks of life hurrying about their business.  People move quickly and with purpose, their eyes fixed on their destination. You can't help but feel a sense of awe and respect for the power and influence of House Lyrandar.
>
> Some are dressed in the fine garb of House Lyrandar and wealthy merchants of House Cannith, while others wear the uniforms of the Sharn Watch or the City Council.
>
> -------------------
> The cacophony of the city engulfs you - the calls of vendors selling their wares, the clattering of hooves as hippogriffs take flight, and the shouts of skycoach drivers competing for fares.
>
> Everywhere you turn, there is something new to see - whether it's a street performer juggling flaming torches or a group of adventurers returning from a successful mission.
>
> -------------------
> Despite the noise and chaos of the city, a sense of energy and possibility permeates the air. The thrum of the magic powering the city and the determination of its people to make their mark on the world make for an exciting atmosphere. The City of Towers feels like a place where anything can happen, and as one explores Sharn, they can't help but feel a sense of adventure and anticipation.

> You feel the hum of magic that powers the city reverberating through the metal beneath your feet. The great airships of House Lyrandar float above, encircled by a halo of elemental energy. The towers of Sharn loom around you, casting long shadows that shift with the setting sun.
>
> -------------------
> You make your way towards the quiet corner of the district where Sergeant Germaine Vilroy asked you to meet and your mind is brought back into focus on your reason for being here. You repeat the words of Germaine's short letter.
>
> "I'm calling on you for a job. I can't write the details, but it pays well and requires your skills. Meet me just outside the airship dock on top of Lyrandar Tower. Come armed."
>
> As you exit the airship dock the crowds disperse to their various lives in the City of Towers. but you remain waiting for Germaine. As you do four other adventurers join you.

## Speaking with Germaine

> As darkness descends on the city, you see windows light up the towers around you from bottom to top. A cool wind whisks between you, drowning out the other noises of the city. A nearby lift rises, carrying a human in her mid-thirties with close cropped black hair and a glowing pipe in her mouth. Germaine gives a wry smile as she nods to you all, saying, "Thanks for coming."
>
> -------------------
> Germaine strides over to the group of you with a confident air. Her bearing and sharp gaze suggest that she has lost none of her military training.
>
> Germaine is tall and stands with a no-nonsense posture that demands respect. Her Brelish heritage is apparent in her sharp features, though years of military service have left their mark in the form of scars and calloused hands.
>
> She keeps her dark hair short and practical, preferring to wear it in a utilitarian style rather than fussing with it. Her eyes are sharp and observant, always scanning her surroundings for potential threats.
>
> Germaine's meticulous attention to detail is reflected in her Sharn Watch uniform which consists of a navy blue coat with brass buttons, black trousers, and a white shirt. The coat is tailored to fit well and has a badge of the Sharn Watch on the breast pocket. Germaine's uniform is well-worn but always neat and clean.
>
> Overall, Germaine's appearance exudes a sense of strength and no-nonsense practicality.
>
> -------------------
> Her gruff demeanor is immediately apparent and she gets straight to business wasting not a moment with small talk.
>
> Germaine gives a wry smile as she nods to you all, saying in a no-nonsense tone, "Good to see you. I asked you to meet me here because I need your help."
>
> -------------------
> Without missing a beat, she launches into the details of the task at hand, making it clear that she doesn't have time for any unnecessary delays or distractions. As she speaks, it's clear that Germaine is a woman who values efficiency and directness. She cuts right to the heart of the matter, outlining what needs to be done and what's at stake.
>
> Despite her gruff manner, there's an unmistakable air of competence and authority about her. It's clear that Germaine is used to being in charge and doesn't suffer fools gladly. But beneath the tough exterior, there's also a sense of deep loyalty and commitment to her fellow soldiers and to the people of Sharn.
>
> Germaine gives you the following information:
>
> - Germaine has an appointment to meet with a warforged named Coal, who claims to have knowledge of a crime being committed in Old Sharn. Germaine wants the party to meet with Coal first and see if what she says adds up. Germaine is worried that, with her status as a Watch sergeant, her presence will call undue attention and endanger Coal.
> - Germaine can give the characters 25 gp each now and another 50 gp each if they bring in Coal.
>
> When she finishs outlining the situation, Germaine asks, "Will you help?"
>
> -------------------
>
- If the characters consent to meet with Coal

> Germaine provides the location of the Cog Carnival, a bar in the High Walls neighborhood of Lower Tavik's Landing that is frequented by warforged, and the appointed meeting time.
>
> Germaine also provides a Sharn Watch writ of enforcement. The writ authorizes the bearers to conduct official duties of the Watch under Sergeant Vilroy's authority. City workers and other members of the Watch respect the writ, sometimes grudgingly, as long as the characters don't engage in flagrantly illegal activity.
>
> Before turning to leave the group to their task, Germaine asks, "Do you have a place to stay yet?"

- If the characters have no place to stay in Sharn, Germaine puts them up at Ghallanda Hall in Middle Dura for the duration of their investigation.
>
> -------------------

- If asked about buying gear and equipment, Germaine suggests The Storm's Forge.

> The Storm's Forge is a well-organized shop located in the Dava Gate district, which is just a short walk from their current location. It is situated on a quiet street and its distinctive sign—a lightning bolt over a shield—makes it easy to spot.
>
> Germaine provides you with detailed directions before saying tell Drogan that I sent you.

Characters should have the following after meeting with Germaine.

- The task of meeting with Coal at the Cog Carnival to see if what she says adds up and report back to Germaine
- The location of Cog Carnival
- 25 GP each
- Promise to collect 50 GP each from Germaine
- The location of Ghallanda Hall
- The location of Storm's Forge

### Making checks against Germaine

Germaine tries to play up her concern for Coal as her reason for hiring the characters, but a character who succeeds on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the Germaine's Charisma (Deception) check can sense that she's holding something back.

A character who talks to Germaine privately and succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check gets her to reveal that she sometimes takes money from the Boromar Clan to look into crimes, and the family is interested in Coal's information (though Germaine also points out that the characters really are Coal's best shot at surviving this ordeal, what with Coal being caught between the two largest criminal syndicates in the city).
