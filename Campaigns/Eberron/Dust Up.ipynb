    "> As you progress toward the settlement you see a deep blue green oasis, about 150 yards round. The surface is still except for the occasional shudder of water as the harsh winds blow across it.\n",
    "> Dinosaur pens with a few dozing Clawfoots flank either end of the town, a warforged struggles to pitch up a canvas tent to cover them.\n",
    "> A farm is tended to at the east end of the oasis where you see the other inhabitants stop, look at the horizon and quickly abandon their work to take cover. A couple of them notice your arrival and gesture frantically to you to get inside a large house as the sandstorm picks up in intensity."

    "  - [House Jorasco](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Jorasco)\n",
    "- The Talentan reverence for spirits derives from the fact that a variety of spirits haunt the Plains. The region contains an unusual number of manifest zones tied to Dolurrh and Thelanis. Ghosts are more likely to linger in such places, and minor fey are scattered across the Plains.\n",
