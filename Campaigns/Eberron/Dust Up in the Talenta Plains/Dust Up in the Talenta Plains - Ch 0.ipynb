    "> As you begun making your way toward the city a pair of halflings in tribal masks approached your group. They each were riding on the back of a [Carver](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Carver). Lean, long-legged bipedal dinosaurs with a feathery, multicolored hide, not unlike a tropical bird, the Carvers have small forearms with sharpened claws, a tail jutting directly out of its rear end and stand about as tall as a human.\n",

    "> The halflings introduced themselves as Evan and Jamir. Evan did most of the talking while Jamir wordlessly ushered each of you into the saddle of your own [Carver](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Carver). Evan explained that House Orien through House Ghallanda had contracted the two of them to serve as guides for your trek into the Blade Desert, with explicit instruction to leave immediately upon your arrival. Apparently sightseeing in the capitol of the Halfling homeland was not in the cards.\n",

A couple of them notice your arrival and gesture frantically to you to get inside a large house with a sign reading \"Tradehouse\" over the door.\n",
