# Mithral Tower

## Entering the district

> Mithral Tower is a highly sought-after residential district in Upper Central Plateau, located in the heart of Sharn. The district is home to some of the wealthiest citizens of the city, who occupy grand homes adorned with mithral filigree. As the characters enter this district, they will be struck by the opulence of their surroundings, with busy scions climbing into skycoaches, hosting lavish parties, and flaunting their latest purchases at all hours of the day. However, the Sharn Watch can be seen patrolling the neighborhood, ensuring that the peace is maintained.

## Arriving at Unicorn Estate

> The Unicorn Estate is one of the many grand homes located in Mithral Tower. Upon arrival, the characters will need to present themselves to the guards at the gate and state their business before they are allowed to enter the property. The estate is decorated with a grand unicorn statue and unicorn-shaped topiaries, which serve as a testament to the wealth and power of the dragonmarked family that owns it.

> The two guards stationed at the gate wear House Orien livery and are equipped with helmets shaped like unicorn heads. Beyond the gate, a magnificent marble home can be seen, owned by one of the wealthiest dragonmarked families in the city. On the patio, two figures can be seen engaged in quiet conversation: a haggard man in his late thirties and an attentive kalashtar who holds a rose-colored crystal in his hands. Two more guards dressed like the ones at the gates stand nearby, watching the estate's surroundings for any potential threats.

## Describing Alden

> Alden d'Orien is a Brelish human noble in his mid-forties. He is tall, standing at around 6'1", with a lean build and a slightly stooped posture that suggests exhaustion. His once-handsome features are now marred by stress, worry lines etched deep into his forehead and around his mouth. His short hair is a dark brown, tinged with gray at the temples. He wears fine, well-tailored clothing, but it hangs loosely on his frame, emphasizing his worn appearance.

## Describing Vishtai

> Vishtai, Alden's assistant, is a kalashtar in his early thirties. He is slightly shorter than Alden, standing at around 5'10", with a slim build and a calm, measured demeanor. His skin is a deep bronze, and his features are sharp and angular. His hair is a glossy black, pulled back into a neat ponytail. He wears simple, practical clothing, with a spellshard attached to his belt. Despite his serious expression, there is a kindness in his eyes that suggests he genuinely cares for Alden and his family.
