# [Chase Rules](https://olddungeonmaster.com/2015/01/17/dd-5e-quick-reference-chase-rules/)

## Chase Steps

1. **Setup**. Determine where everyone involved in the chase is located. The only thing that matters is how far apart everyone is.
   1. Place the lead quarry first,
   2. then place the others at the appropriate distance behind them.
      1. You can randomly set the distance from the lead pursuer to the closest quarry at the speed of the fastest creature + 5x(1d6) feet.
2. **Note Initiative**.
3. **Note Available Dashes**.
   1. You can use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3+ your Constitution modifier.
4. **Note the lead quary's initial move distance**.
5. **Track Rounds of Movement**
   1. On each participant’s turn...
      1. **Play out any Complication** that may apply
         Check whether they want to spend Inspiration to negate a Complication.
      2. Preceed with their turn (i.e. Move, Action)
         If the **Dash action** is taken
            1. Subtract one dash from their pool.
            2. Have them roll a DC10 Constitution saving throw or take one level of exhaustion.
      3. Compare the **distance they moved to that of the lead quarry**.
         1. Note the difference in their movement from that of the lead quarry.
         2. If they are the **same**, the distance between them remains the same, so their **figure doesn’t move**.
         3. If they moved **farther** than the lead quarry, **their figure moves forward by the difference**.
         4. If the moved **less** than the lead quarry, **their figure moves back by the difference**.
      4. Determine whether the **quarry got away or was caught**.
         - **Pursuer Overtakes Quarry**
            A pursuer overtakes a quarry when they moves into its space. They can then use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the creature. Normal grapple rules apply. If successful, both pursuer and quarry are stopped. Rather than grapple, the pursuer may attempt to trip, push over or tackle the quarry. As an optional rule, an attack that fails by 5 or more results in the pursuer falling prone.
         - **Quarry Escapes**
            The quarry can attempt to escape if it is out of sight for all of the pursuers. They make a **Dexterity (Stealth) check vs highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score among the pursuers**.
      5. Have the player roll for a **Complication** to apply to the next characters turn.
         The complication is not applied to their character, but rather to the next character in initiative order. They can spend an inspiration point to negate the complication rolled.

## Chase Rules

**No Opportunity Attacks**. No one involved directly in the chase can use an opportunity attack against anyone else in the chase.

**Prone**. A complication may leave you prone. To get up from prone you subtract half your move distance.

**Difficult Terrain**. Each foot of difficult terrain uses two feet of your move rate. So if you cross five or ten feet of difficult terrain you can simply subtract five or ten feet from your total distance traveled.

## Exhaustion

| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws      |
| 4     | Hit point maximum halved                            |
| 5     | Speed reduced to 0                                  |
| 6     | Death                                               |
