# High Walls

## Entering High Walls

> High Walls is a unique neighborhood in Sharn, located in Lower Tavick's Landing. Its distinguishing feature is the imposing walls that surround it, which were built to provide a sense of security for the refugees of the Last War who reside there. The walls also serve as a means of controlling access to the district, with each of the bridges leading to High Walls featuring massive, magically warded gates that can be sealed at a moment's notice. The gates also serve as fortified Sharn Watch stations to ensure the safety of the neighborhood's inhabitants.

> Despite the walls' promise of safety, High Walls is not the most desirable place to live in Sharn. The district is home to many displaced peoples of Cyre, who were left with nothing after the Last War. The stench of body odor, garbage, and tobacco fills the streets, and the buildings within the district are crumbling and vandalized. However, despite the district's appearance, it remains a place of hope for those who have nowhere else to turn.
>
>As you make your way through High Walls, you can't help but feel the sense of isolation that comes with being cut off from the rest of Sharn. The towers that rise over the walls like imposing sentries only serve to reinforce this feeling. The people of High Walls keep to themselves, and many stand idly on street corners, eying you suspiciously. However, amidst the poverty and despair, there are signs of resilience and determination, with many inhabitants doing their best to make a life for themselves despite the circumstances.
