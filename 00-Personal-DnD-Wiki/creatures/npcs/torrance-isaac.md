# Isaac Torrance

A middle-aged human man with thinning brown hair and a neatly trimmed mustache. He wears a brown tweed suit and a matching bowler hat, giving him the appearance of a gentleman from the last century. Isaac is a high-ranking member of Lyrandar's marketing team and is responsible for promoting the company's airship services. He is known for his charm and persuasive nature, often convincing customers to upgrade to more expensive packages.

Isaac Torrance carries a fine suit of clothes, a signet ring of House Lyrandar, a notebook filled with marketing strategies, a quill pen, a small pouch of gold coins, and a silver-tipped walking cane. In addition, he has a set of traveling clothes and a small satchel containing toiletries and other personal items for long business trips. He also carries a small enchanted amulet, a gift from a powerful Lyrandar mage, which enhances his persuasive abilities during business negotiations.
