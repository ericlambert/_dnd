## Background

Master Toh-sen was born on the Turtle Island, a remote island inhabited by the Tortles, who are renowned for their martial prowess. From a young age, Toh-sen showed an aptitude for combat and a fascination with the shadowy arts. He was soon taken under the tutelage of the legendary Tortle monk, Master Oogway, who taught him the Way of the Shadow.

Toh-sen quickly became a prodigy, mastering the Ansatsuken style of fighting, which emphasizes speed, power, and precision. He also delved deep into the shadowy arts, learning to manipulate darkness and move silently and unseen.

As he grew in skill and knowledge, Toh-sen felt a calling to use his talents for a higher purpose. He traveled to the mainland of Khorvaire and joined the Heavenly Fists of the Assassin, an order of monks dedicated to protecting the innocent and eliminating those who would do harm.

Under the guidance of the order's leader, Master Shiro, Toh-sen honed his skills and became one of the most feared assassins in Breland. He specialized in covert operations, striking from the shadows with deadly accuracy and disappearing without a trace.

Over the years, Toh-sen took on many students, including Josiah Johan, a young man with a natural talent for the martial arts. Toh-sen saw great potential in Josiah and worked tirelessly to help him master the Ansatsuken style and the Way of the Shadow.

Today, Toh-sen is a respected elder of the Heavenly Fists of the Assassin. He continues to train and mentor the next generation of monks, passing on the ancient knowledge and traditions of the Tortle people to those who will carry on the legacy of the order.

## Appearance

Master Toh-sen is a Tortle, standing at about 5'5" tall and weighing around 250 pounds. His skin is a dark green color, and his shell is a deep, earthy brown. He has piercing blue eyes that seem to shine with a quiet intensity, and his face is often adorned with a thick, bushy beard that reaches down to his chest.

Toh-sen is a formidable presence, with a muscular build and a commanding presence. His movements are fluid and precise, and he carries himself with a quiet confidence that speaks to his years of training and experience.

He wears a simple, unadorned black gi, which hangs loosely on his frame, allowing him a full range of motion. A black belt, tied tightly around his waist, holds the gi in place, and a pair of lightweight black boots protect his feet.

At his side, Toh-sen carries a set of slender, curved knives, known as karambits, which he wields with deadly accuracy. The blades are made of a dark, gleaming metal, and are inscribed with intricate symbols that hint at the ancient origins of the Ansatsuken style.

Despite his fearsome reputation and imposing presence, Toh-sen has a quiet, introspective nature. He speaks little, preferring to let his actions speak for him. His eyes, though, betray a deep intelligence and a fierce determination, hinting at the depth of his knowledge and the strength of his conviction.
