## Wild Magic Sorcerer

- Here's [General info about Sorcerers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/sorcerer#Sorcerer)

### The Origin of the Power

Lelie's power comes from wild magic, which means the innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. This magic churns within her, waiting for any outlet.

- Does she know or have a theory about the exact source of her power?
  - Is it a family curse, passed down to her from distant ancestors? 
  - Did some extraordinary event leave her blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?
  - She might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the Far Realm. 
  - Perhaps she was blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. 
  - Or her magic could be a fluke of her birth, with no apparent cause.

### How Lelie feels about the Power

- How does Lelie feel about the magical power coursing through her?
  - Does she embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature?
  - Is it a blessing or a curse?
  - Did she seek it out, or did it find her?
  - Did she have the option to refuse it, and does she wish she had?
  - What does she intend to do with it?
    - Perhaps she feels like she’s been given this power for some lofty purpose.
    - Or she might decide that the power gives her the right to do what she wants, to take what she wants from those who lack such power. 
    - Perhaps her power links her to a powerful individual in the world? Who is that individual?

## Wood Elf

- Most elves, whether Aereni (high-elves) or Tairnadal (wood-elves) live on an island separate from Khorvaire called Aerenal. Small numbers of elves have migrated to Khorvaire over the centuries though.
  - What is Lelie's story about how her family/ancestors came to leave Aeranel for Khorvaire?

### Tradition among the Elves

- Elves are generally driven by tradition and respect for the past.
  - What is Lelie's relationship with the past?
  - Does she value the traditions of her ancestors? Or does she fear that her people are too mired in the past and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?
- Most Tairnadal have a tradition of revering a patron ancestor related to their class / profession. Whatever that patron's path, it is your duty to follow their example.
  - Who is the legendary ancestral hero of the Tairnadel elves that Lelie has 
  - Is this something Lelie proudly embraces, or does she resist it? 
  - Does Lelie know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what’s your relationship to that character?
  - Does Lelie know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of hers?
  - Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? 
  - Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor’s legendary deeds? 
  - Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? 
  - Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?

### Elves Live Longer

- If Lelie was born and raised in Khorvaire, she has grown up among the shorter-lived races. 
- She might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Tairnadal back on Aerenal but would know of the traditions. 
- She could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.
- Consider also whether Lelie has outlived human friends and how that might affect her.
- Did she know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party?
- Is she trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to a long-dead friend?
- Is she trying to recapture some spark of the friendship she felt years ago? 
- Does she remember a time before the Last War?
- Did she fight in the war?
