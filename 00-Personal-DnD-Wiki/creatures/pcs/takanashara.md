## Male Kalashtar Cleric Grave Domain

[Character Sheet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/95702103)

## Player Notes

### Organizations

Path of Light (Loosely, through a small and now defunct home lead meeting group.)

### Allies

Hervy Fishman, Dwarf Attorney at Law

### Enemies

The party of adventures that were sued due to the damages they caused, though Acquisitions Inc. covered their lawsuit the strongest member of their group was imprisoned due to the amount of damage and harm they caused which causes the group to hold a grudge against me.

### Backstory

I used to be the leader of a small community of those dedicated to the Path of Light in Sharn until I allowed a group of adventures to take shelter in my home. They were pursued by their enemies and a fight broke up causing massive destruction to my home and the surrounding area. Many of my congregation were killed, some of which right in front of me. As they lay dying there was little to do but comfort them in their final moments, but in the aftermath I was able to file a lawsuit against those responsible with the help of an attorney who took pity on my case. Overtime I became good friends with this drawf and now regularly see him as long as I'm in the area. In the settlement Acquisitions Inc. offered to allow me to continue to my journey along the path of light in a greater compacity teaching me how to properly draw upon the power of Il-Yannah to manifest the change that this world is long overdue for.

### Other

The Quiori spirit will sometimes suggest things to add to my cooking recipes to extremely varied results. Black and Green butterfly/moth motif. My Quiori spirit apears as a as a fuzzy moth with 4 pairs of eyes and 8 legs with long whips extending from its tail. The spirt will encourage me to shelter the dying, strike down those who it view as  agents of the Dreaming Dark, and trust new people. The spirit also has a strange obsession with the smell of cinnamon and will frequently ask me to burn some for him instead of eating it.

### Personality Traits

Having just received a windfall of money and training I am curious to the pleasures of the outside world, having spent much of my life sheltered and poor. I have always tried to make the best of a bad situation. I’m always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Though I try to remain reserved and collected my spirit is much more rambunctious and will encourage parties and other outbursts if it seems them as entertaining. The quiori spirit can't stand to be bored for very long and will annoy me if I don't keep him occupied, fortunately he can be quelled for some time with puzzles.

### Ideals

Humility. I’m just a small part of a larger whole. So is everyone else. (Neutral)

### Bonds

My legal counsel is my best friend. I owe all my forthcoming opportunities to their hard work.

### Flaws

Three magic beans for just one cow? What a deal! Will perform poorly at puzzles as his spirit can distract him with its own poor guesses.
