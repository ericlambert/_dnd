## Player Notes

### Organizations

Heavenly Fists of the Assassin - Student of the wise and powerful Master Tosen, practitioner of the Ansetsuken fighting style.

### Backstory

Josiah was the first born of three to a family of farmers. Humble folk in their village and middle-class with the abundance in crops and cattle their family were known for earning their income through. In his early teens, Josiah's village had been attacked by a large mass of bloodthirsty orcs and goblins. All of the men in the village had been slain, including Josiah's father. All of the women and children held captive. Josiah was able to escape with the help of his mother before her eventual capture. Before Josiah could get to the village's outskirts, he was ambushed by a small group of the goblins.

Before he would succumb to death from the attacks of the goblins, he had been saved by an elderly tortle by the name of Toh-sen. The elder defeated the goblins in seconds. This power was something that could help Josiah free the survivors of his village. Josiah begged Master Toh-sen to teach him his technique of fighting. Master Toh-sen informed the boy that his teaching would take no more than a month. The result would be that Josiah either became adept in what was known as Assassin's fist, or die from the training alone.

## DM Questions?

- Are you okay with saying that Josiah's family farm is near the town of [Ardev](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Ardev)? It's in western Breland near the boarder with Droaam. If orcs and goblins were to attack in Breland it would likely come from Droaam.
