## Player Notes

### Organizations

Heavenly Fists of the Assassin - Student of the wise and powerful Master Tosen, practitioner of the Ansetsuken fighting style.

### Backstory

Josiah was the first born of three to a family of farmers. Humble folk in their village near the town of [Ardev](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Ardev) and middle-class with the abundance in crops and cattle their family were known for earning their income through. In his early teens, Josiah's village had been attacked by a large mass of bloodthirsty orcs and goblins. All of the men in the village had been slain, including Josiah's father. All of the women and children held captive. Josiah was able to escape with the help of his mother before her eventual capture. Before Josiah could get to the village's outskirts, he was ambushed by a small group of the goblins.

Before he would succumb to death from the attacks of the goblins, he had been saved by an elderly tortle by the name of Toh-sen. The elder defeated the goblins in seconds. This power was something that could help Josiah free the survivors of his village. Josiah begged Master Toh-sen to teach him his technique of fighting. Master Toh-sen informed the boy that his teaching would take no more than a month. The result would be that Josiah either became adept in what was known as Assassin's fist, or die from the training alone.

Master Toh-sen and long-time students of his trained Josiah not far from his farm/home. The Heavenly Fists of the Assassin is a very freeform monk monastery with less than 20 known students. Of those aligned with the monastery is elderly tortle Master Toh-sen, one of the two eldest masters. The name of the monastery comes from the fighting style of ansetsuken which translates to "Assassin's Fist".

"Those who harness the assassin's fist guide those who receive its wrath to Heaven."

## DM Questions?

- ~~Are you okay with saying that Josiah's family farm is near the town of [Ardev](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Ardev)? It's in western Breland near the boarder with Droaam. If orcs and goblins were to attack in Breland it would likely come from Droaam.~~
- Tell me more about the Heavenly Fists of the Assassin
  - ~~Is Master Tosen the leader? or is he one of many masters in the organization?~~
  - ~~Where is the location that you trained?~~
