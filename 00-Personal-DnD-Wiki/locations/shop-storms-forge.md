The Storm's Forge is a reputable shop that specializes in high-quality armor and weapons. It is owned and operated by a former Lyrandar Tower guard named Drogan Stormhelm, who has a deep knowledge of the unique needs and preferences of the Lyrandar family.

## Description

The Storm's Forge is a well-organized shop located in the Dava Gate district, which is just a short walk from the Lyrandar Tower. It is situated on a quiet street and its distinctive sign—a lightning bolt over a shield—makes it easy to spot.

Inside, the air is filled with the sounds of metal clanging and hammers striking anvils. The walls are lined with shelves holding various tools, weapons, and armor. The store is clean and tidy, with everything in its place.

Drogan Stormhelm, the owner of the shop, is a towering figure with broad shoulders and a thick beard. He wears a leather apron over a chain shirt and is constantly covered in soot and grime from working in the forge. His booming voice echoes throughout the shop as he greets customers and offers his assistance.

Tilda Steelheart, Drogan's assistant, is a shorter figure with a slim build and fiery red hair. She wears a similar leather apron and chain shirt as Drogan, but keeps hers much cleaner. She can often be seen polishing weapons or organizing the shop while Drogan is working the forge. Despite her small size, she has a confident demeanor and a quick wit that customers find endearing.

## Added item

Spear of Spiritual Radiance Rare

This magical spear would deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage on a hit, which is particularly effective against undead and fiends. Additionally, once per day, the wielder can use an action to activate the spear's special ability, which causes it to emit a bright burst of spiritual energy in a 15-foot cone in front of them. Creatures in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage and be blinded for 1 minute. Undead and fiends have disadvantage on this saving throw.

This magical spear would be particularly useful for a Cleric who frequently engages in combat against undead and fiends, and who wants to have an additional option for dealing radiant damage. Additionally, the blinding effect of the spear's special ability can be a useful tool for disabling enemies and allowing the Cleric and their allies to gain the upper hand in combat.
