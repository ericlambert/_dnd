    "## Travel in Sharn\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it’s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:\n",

    "# Dava Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dava Gate district is a lively and bustling area located in the upper wards of Sharn, the City of Towers. It is named after the Dava Gate, one of the main entrances to the city. The district is known for its diverse population, as well as its thriving markets and bazaars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The district is home to many of Sharn's wealthiest residents, including prominent nobles and successful merchants. It is also a popular destination for visitors to the city, as it offers a wide range of shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous landmarks in the Dava Gate district is the Grand Bazaar, a massive open-air market that stretches for blocks and sells everything from exotic spices and rare textiles to magical artifacts and enchanted weapons. Other notable attractions in the area include the House Sivis message station, where travelers can send and receive messages via magical means, and the University of Wynarn, a prestigious academic institution that offers courses in a variety of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its reputation for wealth and prosperity, the Dava Gate district is not without its dangers. The area is known to be frequented by criminal organizations such as the Boromar Clan, and adventurers are advised to be cautious when exploring its alleys and side streets."

    "# Dura\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharn began where Dura stands, but the city has left it behind in many ways. Many nowadays consider the oldest quarter of Sharn to be a blight on the City of Towers. The place is full of cracked and crumbling stonework, abandoned lift shafts, and everbright lanterns that have burned out and never been restored. Dura is riddled with poverty and crime; it's easily the most dangerous section of the city. But it also holds opportunities you can't find anywhere else. If you're looking for smuggled goods or a place to lie low, head to Dura.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle Dura caters to the working class. Its taverns are modestly priced, but there's gold among the dross.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bazaar of Dura is the largest commercial district in Sharn. In addition to the dozens of permanent shops and smithies, the streets of the bazaar are an ever-changing tapestry of stalls and tents. It's said that you can find anything here, if you're not too worried about where it came from and if you're prepared to contend with the cutpurses that prey on the crowds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elsewhere in Middle Dura, the district of Hareth's Folly is a bizarre blend of architectural styles. One of the primary attractions is the Hollow Tower, an enormous arena that features aerial jousting and racing. The King of Fire is a grand tavern that hosts a broad range of gambling and bookmaking activities, legal and otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people make their homes in Middle Dura, even if their jobs take them elsewhere. Rattlestone and Tumbledown are mostly poor tenements. Stormhold contains crumbling manors still occupied by some of Sharn's oldest families, while many that have prospered have moved on to more prestigious districts."
