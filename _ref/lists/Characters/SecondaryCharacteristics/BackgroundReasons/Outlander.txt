I spent a lot of time in the wilderness as a youngster, and I came to love that way of life.
From a young age, I couldnâ€™t abide the stink of the cities and preferred to spend my time in nature.
I came to understand the darkness that lurks in the wilds, and I vowed to combat it.
My people lived on the edges of civilization, and I learned the methods of survival from my family.
After a tragedy I retreated to the wilderness, leaving my old life behind.
My family moved away from civilization, and I learned to adapt to my new environment.
