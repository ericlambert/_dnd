I resented authority in my younger days and saw a life of crime as the best way to fight against tyranny and oppression.
Necessity forced me to take up the life, since it was the only way I could survive.
I fell in with a gang of reprobates and ne’er-do-wells, and I learned my specialty from them.
A parent or relative taught me my criminal specialty to prepare me for the family business.
I left home and found a place in a thieves’ guild or some other criminal organization.
I was always bored, so I turned to crime to pass the time and discovered I was quite good at it.
