Wanderlust caused me to leave my family to see the world. I look after myself.
I ran away from a bad situation at home and made my own way in the world.
Monsters wiped out my village, and I was the sole survivor. I had to find a way to survive.
A notorious thief looked after me and other orphans, and we spied and stole to earn our keep.
One day I woke up on the streets, alone and hungry, with no memory of my early childhood.
My parents died, leaving no one to look after me. I raised myself.
