I ran away from home at an early age and found refuge in a temple.
My family gave me to a temple, since they were unable or unwilling to care for me.
I grew up in a household with strong religious convictions. Entering the service of one or more gods seemed natural.
An impassioned sermon struck a chord deep in my soul and moved me to serve the faith.
I followed a childhood friend, a respected acquaintance, or someone I loved into religious service.
After encountering a true servant of the gods, I was so inspired that I immediately entered the service of a religious group.
