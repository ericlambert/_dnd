I learned what was right and wrong from my family.
I was always enamored by tales of heroes and wished I could be something more than ordinary.
I hated my mundane life, so when it was time for someone to step up and do the right thing, I took my chance.
A parent or one of my relatives was an adventurer, and I was inspired by that personâ€™s courage.
A mad old hermit spoke a prophecy when I was born, saying that I would accomplish great things.
I have always stood up for those who are weaker than I am.
