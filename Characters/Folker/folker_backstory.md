Folker stands just over 6ft tall and has a slightly bulky frame. He has a handsome face with short dark brown hair.

In passing one would not know it but Folker is physically blind and wears a strip of cloth over his eyes.

He has Blindsight with allows him to "see" as though with normal eyesight up to 10ft away.

As a result, he generally moves similarly to how a sighted person moves just a bit more leisurely.

He wears a dark blue cloak over chainmail armor. Leather pants and tall boots. On his left hip he carries a coiled whip. On the right side a small hand crossbow.

He is human with a very pale complexion common to those with lineage tied to the cold landscape of the far northland.

He stands proudly with his head held high as if in thought. This is because he is usually actively surveying his surroundings using his non-sight senses.

## Character Timeline

### Early life

**Birthplace:** Icewind Dale - Ten-Towns - Easthaven; Home of a healer or midwife (healer)
**Family lifestyle:** Poor (-10)
**Childhood Home:** Small house
**Childhood memories:** Folker had a few close friends and lived an ordinary childhood.

**Family:**
Folker was raised in **Icewind Dale's Ten-towns** settlements, specifically the town of **Easthaven**.

His mother abandoned him just a few years after his birth then, while Folker was still quite young, his father **Frank** died under suspicious circumstances. Folker knows few details about his parents but has come to understand that his father's death had something to do with a criminal endeavor gone wrong.

When Folker's father died, the man's closest friends **Marie and Agni Nicklegem** took Folker in. Even prior to the loss of his father, he would have called Marie his mother. She is the healer who oversaw Folker's birth in the bedroom of their small home and was a mother figure after Folker's biological mother left. Though Agni was absent for most of his childhood, Folker considers the pair to have raised him and took on the Nicklegem name before leaving home.

Many years after Folker had grown, Marie confided that taking him in was not just due to charity and the close relationship she and Agni had with his father but also as a sense of responsibility for the circumstances of the man's death. Marie herself knows no details of that death but she does know that Agni got the two men mixed up with some kind of black-market dealing and Folker's father paid the heavier price.

Today, in failing health, Agni strikes Folker as a sad, troubled and broken man who in his "prime" was unable to resist scheming to make a quick buck. Conversing with Agni today is a confused and foggy affair until one brings up the topic of money making at which point the man becomes remarkably cogent. However, Folker cannot deny that whatever Agni did in the past managed to satisfy his part in raising five children. Folker is friendly with his adoptive father but that is as far as it goes. At the back of Folker's mind has lied the possibility that Agni's past may bring the man into conflict with Folker's Oath.

By the time they took on Folker, Agni and Marie Nicklegem had already begun raising children of their own. Folker considers them to be his younger siblings and has a positive relationship with all of them.

- **eldest sister Tove** is just slightly younger than Folker and was alive when he came to live with the Nicklegems. She left home about a year after Folker did and trained as a monk. Today she is an adventurer of some renown around the Ten-Towns and Luskan.

- **brothers Meilin and Jun** were both born after Folker's father died and just a year apart. Both moved south from Icewind Dale to herd sheep in the countryside outside of Neverwinter. From what Folker has gathered, the older Meilin has a questionable reputation with the locals there but the younger Jun seems to keep him from straying too far from respectability.

- **youngest sister Elektra** was born after Folker had left home to train as a paladin, so he has less of a relationship with her but Folker does know that after some trouble as adolescent she became a priest and has stayed close to home, helping Marie care for Agni and caring for both of them as they age.

### Young Adulthood

#### Witness to Evil

When Folker was young Rudolph van Richten, the famous monster hunter, stayed in Easthaven for a few months while on the trail of a vampire he believe had fled the cities of the southern Sword Coast to the cold and darkness of Icewind Dale.

Van Richten's search culminated in a terrifying battle in the heart of the town between himself, the vampire and it's minions. van Richten, of course, won out in the end however multiple critical structures in Easthaven were in ruins.

<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/icewind-dale/images/6/6f/AR1000_Easthaven.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20191027152015"/>

At one point a cloud of bats descended on Folker and his brothers as they hid behind a traveller's wagon some distance from the fighting. The older and stronger Folker carried his younger brothers to safety as they covered their faces from the claws and biting of the bats. Folker, eyes open took multiple slashes and bites to his head and upper body in the process. The wounds were superficial and within Marie's skill to heal with the exception of those inflicted to Folker's eyes, which he would never regain the use of. Though Folker had been physically blinded by the bats, curiously he suffered no disease as a result of the attack. Something unseen in all of the many other cases of bat attacks that had been inflicted on the locals of Easthaven in the weeks leading up to van Richten's final confrontation.

In the end, the destruction his quest had wrought on the town seemed invisible to van Richten who appeared content to call the another monsterslaying successful before he moved on from Easthaven. As he did many who called Easthaven home laid in recovery some of whom did not make it.

A few days into his own recovery, Folker miraculously woke with a strange new sensation. He was once again aware of his immediate surroundings just as though he could see them. But it was not sight in the way he had known it. Marie would explain it as blindsight, a condition she had heard of before but never witnessed.

##### Folker recanted these events in this way during Session 1

> I tell you... vampires are very real.
>
> In the far north of the Sword Coast lies the Icewind Dale settlements of the Ten Towns. Easthaven is one of the larger of them.
>
> Once a vile unnatural evil came to Easthaven and on it's heels a great monster hunter. The hunter stayed in Easthaven for weeks, enjoying the respect and awe of the townsfolk while he searched for his quarry. The hunter believed the vampire to be finally fleeing trouble in the lower cities of the Sword Coast and recanted many tales of his encounters with the creature over them years.
>
> Eventually the hunter and the vampire battled openly in the streets of Easthaven. The hunter vanquished the evil, but not before ravaging the town. Many homes crumbled, many lives were lost.
>
> When the hunter left, the townsfolk put the pieces back together and mourned their lost.
>
> To this day all in Easthaven spit at the mention of vampires but the town is divided in how they think of the hunter. Some claim his departure was filled with a prideful, callousness that ignored the destruction his quest brought upon the town. He even scoffed at being asked to pay his inn tab... some say.

#### You're a paladin Folker

As part of the recovery effort, a paladin named Nausikaa journeyed to Easthaven. Hearing of the Folker's acts of bravery and of the blindsight the boy had been endowed with, she sought Folker out. After meeting him, Nausikaa saw great potential in Folker and believed the blindsight to be a blessing that Helm bestowed on him in return for the virtue and bravery the boy had shown in protecting his brothers.

**Nausikaa Soleil**
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/d6/3d/83d63d9028c0f4bed3658a158800becc.jpg" alt="Nausikaa" title="Female Paladin" width="300"/>
Name: Nausikaa Soleil
Gender: Female
Race: Human
Alignment: Neutral
Class: Paladin - Oath of Redemption
Relationship: Friendly (Mentor)
Status: Alive and quite successful

She convinced Marie to let her take Folker on as her squire. As such Folker journeyed with Nausikaa to [Helm's Hold](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Helm%27s_Hold) south east of Neverwinter where Nausikaa trained him in the ways of a paladin for the remainder of his youth.

---

### Early Adventures

Not long after his initial training with Nausikaa Soleil, Folker struck out on his own wandering the Sword Coast seeking to use his divine powers to aid and protect lost souls in need of redemption.

> Session 0 established that Folker considers this to have been a time of "Monster Hunting". He claims to have fought werewolves among other creatures. Although he was unaware of the weakness to silver that all werewolves share so his claim is considered unreliable by the party.

Not long after that he strayed from the light.

#### The Gambler

In the ruined and declining city of Luskan, while living in destitude and extreme suffering amongst the warehouses of the Northern Bank, Folker miraculously gathered winnings from a dice game that could last a lifetime. As he saw it (and still believes) Tymora blessed him that day. He began gambling seriously after that. Folker began spendining much of his time at [Clearlight](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clearlight), Luskan's run down temple to Tymora, though it would be a long time before Tymora would bless him in the same way again.

Eventually Folker became indebted to a powerful yet benevolent crime boss named The Quillsharpener. Through his organization, [The Coin Spinners](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Coin_Spinners), The Quillsharpener allowed Folker to work off his debts by performing various innocuous tasks around town.

Folker began to attribute more and more of his divine powers to the goddess Tymora and even the god of lies Cyric who had at times blessed him in games of cards and aided him in his tasks for The Quillsharpener. Helm, it appeared, had turned his favor elsewhere but Folker's powers remained so he barely noticed the shift in thier source.

It wasn't until Folker happened across Nausikaa, the paladin mentor from his youth, that it became apparent to Folker what had happened. The stark contrast between he and her, the sadness in her gaze as she took in who Folker had become. She looked at him the way she looked at the souls she had worked to redeem while he trained under her all those years ago. It took only that look from Nausikaa for the reality of The Quillsharpener's game to suddenly become clear. One hard look to reveal the depth of Cyric's blessings which had allowed Folker to deceive himself into a life far from the that which he had intended.

As he thought back on his recent jobs, he could no longer miss the fear and desperation in voices of those he collected "taxes" from for The Coin Spinners. When, at The Quillsharpener's behest, he helped yet another shopkeeper clean up and replace a broken shop window (for a fee to be collected later of course), he now understood why there was a thinly hidden note of disdain to the frustration in the shopkeeper's voice. He understood too the sneering looks he got from those among The Quillsharpener's ranks when they issued his orders for the day, not to mention the spiteful laughs he heard after he turned his back to leave the room.

Folker was humiliated and angry.

He began to plot the end of The Quillsharpener's hold on the neighborhood around him. The goal was simple, he would climb the ranks of The Coin Spinners and, when the time was right, behead it. The gifts of Tymora and Cyric would help him in this quest. And so he did just that.

And when he stood before The Quillsharpener's empty "throne", Folker realized the vengeance he had found was not that of the neighborhood around him, but his own... no more, no less. With this realization Folker once again felt the blessing of Helm, the protector. He would not assume the Quillsharpener's power himself but instead called forth the people of the neighborhood to decide how best to use it.

There were of course some remnants of The Coin Spinners who sought to 'fill the power vacuum' and take up the mantle of The Quillsharpener and revive the criminal undertaking before a new order could be established.

They were smited.

Before long the neighborhood was in the hands of good honest folk who trusted each other. Folker's next chapter awaited him.

### Immediately Before Gameplay

#### An Oath Taken

On the morning before our campaign starts, Folker quietly swore his Oath of Vengeance at [The Plinth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plinth), which prior to the Spellplague in 1385 DR was a tall floating tower located in Waterdeep midway between the Way of the Dragon and The High Road south of where the two roads cross in the Trade's Ward. The Plinth was dedicated to the worship of any or all deities and administered by city officials. Today, over 100 years later, The Plinth stands as overgrown ruins which occupy a single city block and only recently have begun being restored by the city for use for the same purpose, albeit much more humbly.

Filled with purpose, Folker made his way back to Trollskull Manor, the inn where he and his traveling companions had taken up residence for the past few days.

## Mindset

### Personality Traits

**Nothing is certain.** Planning is a coward’s act.
I have beaten my addiction, but all it takes is one weak moment and I’ll be back at the card table.

### Ideals

**Reliability.** When I was in need, I was able to rely on others. Now I want to be the one others rely on. (Good)

### Bonds

A criminal syndicate I once played for isn’t happy I left the game, and its enforcers are looking for me.

### Flaws

I was once a terribly flawed person, like you. Let me tell you how you can save yourself.

### Values

#### Folker's Oath of Vengeance

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside - at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins—sometimes called avengers or dark knights—their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.

> *From this time forward I solemnly pledge,
to punish mercilessly any who,
through their dark pursuits of power
or everlasting, unnatural life,
have wantonly visited pain and destruction,
upon the innocent.*
>
> *I further pledge to protect and aid,
those harmed by these villains.
For the ruin they suffer,
I failed to prevent.*
>
> *I pledge these actions even at the loss,
of my own righteousness.
For nothing shall be saved,
in the face of these evils.*

This Oath of Vengeance carries with it the following brutally simple tenets.

**Fight the Greater Evil.** Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foe(s) or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.
**No Mercy for the Wicked.** Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.
**By Any Means Necessary.** My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.
**Restitution.** If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

### Beliefs

To Folker, his devotion to his Oath is a much higher priority than his faith in any of the gods directly. Higher still than his own righteousness. It might be fair to say his Oath is his only true God though, it does not manifest and carries no personification like the Gods of the realms do. He believes his divine powers have been bestowed by some of the gods because the impact of his actions to further the will of those gods not because of a faith in those gods.

Now that he has sworn it, as long as he stays true to his Oath he will be able to draw on those powers.

Despite having no driving faith in an particular God of the realms, Folker does possess powers that he considers to be divine blessings. Since those powers are not the result of faith they must be the result of his actions, he reasons. He prays most often to the gods of the realms who would be most likely to value his past deeds and his intentions for future deeds. Those deities are;
**Helm** - god of protection; *staring eye on upright left gauntlet*
**Cyric** - god of lies; *white jawless skull on black or purple sunburst*
**Tymora** - goddess of good fortune; *face-up coin*

---

## Lifestyle

Folker generally lives a life in squalor (1SP/day). He seeks out lodging in the rough parts of town because it is there that he is most likely to find those wronged by the evil deeds of others. His immunity to disease makes it a bit safer to live in this setting as well.

---

## Secrets

Folker's believes that his Oath necessitates that he smite not only vampires but Rudolph van Richten as well. For the famous monster hunter was equally complicit in the destruction of Easthaven and the suffering it inflicted. He not will not tell people this. In fact, he will actively lie to hide it. van Richten is beloved and hailed as a hero. If he is to succeed in punishing the monster hunter, Folker best keep his intentions to do so a secret.
