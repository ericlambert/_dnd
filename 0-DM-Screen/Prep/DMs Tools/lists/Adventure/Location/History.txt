Abandoned by creators
Abandoned due to plague
Conquered by invaders
Destroyed by attacking raiders
Destroyed by discovery made within the site
Destroyed by internal conflict
Destroyed by magical catastrophe
Destroyed by natural disaster
Cursed by the gods and shunned
Overrun by planar creatures
The site of a great miracle
