 good to be the dungeon master! Not only do you get to tell fantastic 
stories about heroes, villains, monsters, and magic, but you also get to
 create the world in which these stories live. Whether you're running a 
D&amp;D game already or you think it's something you want to try, this 
book is for you.</p><p>The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> assumes that 
you know the basics of how to play the D&amp;D tabletop roleplaying 
game. If you haven't played before, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter 
Set is a great starting point for new players and DMs.</p><p>This book 
has two important companions: the Player's Handbook, which contains the 
rules your players need to create characters and the rules you need to 
run the game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to use 
monsters to populate your D&amp;D world.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="2" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Dungeon Master</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p4</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force behind a D&amp;D game. The DM
 creates a world for the other players to explore, and also creates and 
runs adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically hinges on 
the successful completion of a quest, and can be as short as a single 
game session. Longer adventures might embroil players in great conflicts
 that require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung together, 
these adventures form an ongoing <b>campaign.</b> A D&amp;D campaign can include dozens of adventures and last for months or years.</p><p>A
 Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the architect of a campaign, 
the DM creates adventures by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for 
the other players' characters (the <b>adventurers</b>) to discover. As a
 storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize what's happening 
around them, improvising when the adventurers do something or go 
somewhere unexpected. As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the 
monsters and supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a 
referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to abide by them 
and when to change them.</p><p>Inventing, writing, storytelling, 
improvising, acting, refereeing-every DM handles these roles 
differently, and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It helps 
to remember that Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a hobby, and being the DM 
should be fun. Focus on the aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For
 example, if you don't like creating your own adventures, you can use 
published ones. You can also lean on the other players to help you with 
rules mastery and world-building.</p><p>The D&amp;D rules help you and 
the other players have a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. 
You're the DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your goal 
isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a campaign world that 
revolves around their actions and decisions, and to keep your players 
coming back for more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will 
echo in the memories of your players long after the final game session 
is concluded.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="3" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">How to Use This Book</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p4</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>This
 book is organized in three parts. The first part helps you decide what 
kind of campaign you'd like to run. The second part helps you create the
 adventures-the stories-that will compose the campaign and keep the 
players entertained from one game session to the next. The last part 
helps you adjudicate the rules of the game and modify them to suit the 
style of your campaign.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="4" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Part 1: Master of Worlds</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p4</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Every
 DM is the creator of his or her own campaign world. Whether you invent a
 world, adapt a world from a favorite movie or novel, or use a published
 setting for the D&amp;D game, you make that world your own over the 
course of a campaign.</p><p>The world where you set your campaign is one of countless worlds that make up the D&amp;D <b>multiverse</b>,
 a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures happen. Even if 
you're using an established world such as the Forgotten Realms, your 
campaign takes place in a sort of mirror universe of the official 
setting where Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital games 
are assumed to take place. The world is yours to change as you see fit 
and yours to modify as you explore the consequences of the players' 
actions.</p><p>Your world is more than just a backdrop for adventures. 
Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless other fantasy worlds out 
there, it's a place to which you can escape and witness fantastic 
stories unfold. A well-designed and well-run world seems to flow around 
the adventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead of apart 
from it.</p><p>Consistency is a key to a believable fictional world. 
When the adventurers go back into town for supplies, they should 
encounter the same <b>nonplayer characters</b> (NPCs) they met before. 
Soon, they'll learn the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember 
theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of consistency, you 
can provide an occasional change. If the adventurers come back to buy 
more horses at the stables, they might discover that the man who ran the
 place went back home to the large city over the hills, and now his 
niece runs the family business. That sort of change-one that has nothing
 to do with the adventurers directly, but one that they'll notice-makes 
the players feel as though their characters are part of a living world 
that changes and grows along with them.</p><p>Part 1 of this book is all
 about inventing your world. Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want 
to run, and helps you nail down a few important details about your world
 and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you put your world in 
the greater context of the multiverse, expanding on the information 
presented in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> to discuss the planes of existence and the gods and how you can put them together to serve the needs of your campaign.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="5" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Part 2: Master of Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p5</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Whether
 you write your own adventures or use published ones, expect to invest 
preparation time beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll 
need to carve out some free time to exercise your creativity as you 
invent compelling plots, create new NPCs, craft encounters, and think of
 clever ways to foreshadow story events yet to come.</p><p>Part 2 of 
this book is devoted to helping you create and run great adventures. 
Chapter 3 covers the basic elements of a D&amp;D adventure, and chapter 4
 helps you create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines and 
advice for running adventures set in dungeons, the wilderness, and other
 locales, and chapter 6 covers the time between adventures. Chapter 7 is
 all about treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help keep the
 players invested in your campaign.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="6" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Part 3: Master of Rules</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p5</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Dungeons
 &amp; Dragons isn't a head-to-head competition, but it needs someone 
who is impartial yet involved in the game to guarantee that everyone at 
the table plays by the rules. As the player who creates the game world 
and the adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural fit to
 take on the referee role.</p><p>As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator
 between the rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or she
 wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is successful or not, in 
some cases asking the player to make a die roll to determine success. 
For example, if a player wants his or her character to take a swing at 
an orc, you say, "Make an attack roll" while looking up the orc's Armor 
Class.</p><p>The rules don't account for every possible situation that 
might arise during a typical D&amp;D session. For example, a player 
might want his or her character to hurl a brazier full of hot coals into
 a monster's face. How you determine the outcome of this action is up to
 you. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, while mentally
 setting the <b>Difficulty Class</b> (DC) at 15. If the Strength check 
is successful, you then determine how a face full of hot coals affects 
the monster. You might decide that it deals <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d4&quot;}">1d4</span>
 fire damage and imposes disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls 
until the end of its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the 
player do it), and the game continues.</p><p>Sometimes mediating the 
rules means setting limits. If a player tells you, "I want to run up and
 attack the orc," but the character doesn't have enough movement to 
reach the orc, you say, "It's too far away to move up and still attack. 
What would you like to do instead?" The player takes the information and
 comes up with a different plan.</p><p>To referee the rules, you need to
 know them. You don't have to memorize this book or the Player's 
Handbook, but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, 
when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to find the proper 
reference.</p><p>The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you need 
to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth of information to 
help you adjudicate the rules in a wide variety of situations. Chapter 8
 presents advice for using attack rolls, ability checks, and saving 
throws. It also includes options appropriate for certain play styles and
 campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, a system for 
handling chase scenes, and rules for madness. If you like to create your
 own stuff, such as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, 
chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains optional rules for 
unusual situations or play styles, such as the use of firearms in a 
fantasy setting.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="7" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Know Your Players</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p6</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 success of a D&amp;D game hinges on your ability to entertain the other
 players at the game table. Whereas their role is to create characters 
(the protagonists of the campaign), breathe life into them, and help 
steer the campaign through their characters' actions, your role is to 
keep the players (and yourself) interested and immersed in the world 
you've created, and to let their characters do awesome things.</p><p>Knowing
 what your players enjoy most about the D&amp;D game helps you create 
and run adventures that they will enjoy and remember. Once you know

most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your players' preferences

 present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&amp;D work. 
Among the established settings of D&amp;D, the Forgotten Realms, 
Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don't stray very far from those 
assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer,

 gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming 
dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea. 
Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their 
followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a
 god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to 
further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk 
might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their existence.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="19" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Much of the World Is Untamed</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p9</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Wild

 rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by 
imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually 
claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and

 individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and factions of 
like-minded individuals can alter the course of history. Factions 
include religions led by charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting
 dynasties, and shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. 
The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each
 other for power. Some seek to preserve the world and usher in a golden 
age. Others strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with an 
iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from the practical to the 
esoteric, such as the accumulation of material wealth or the 
resurrection of a dead god. Whatever their goals, these factions 
inevitably collide, creating conflict that can steer the world's fate.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="22" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The World Is Magical</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p9</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Practitioners
 of magic are relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of their
 craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a 
potion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, 
such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a 
city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches of magic items 
guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons 
inhabited by monsters created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with
 magical abilities.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="23" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">It's Your World</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p9</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 creating your campaign world, it helps to start with the core 
assumptions and consider how your setting might change them. The 
subsequent sections of this chapter address each element and give 
details on how to flesh out your world with gods, factions, and so 
forth. The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved in stone. They 
inspire exciting D&amp;D worlds full of adventure, but they're not the 
only set of assumptions that can do so. You can build an interesting 
campaign concept by altering one or more of those core assumptions, just
 as well-established D&amp;D worlds have done. Ask yourself, "What if 
the standard assumptions weren't true in my world?"</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="24" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The World Is a Mundane Place</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p9</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>What

 B of the Player's Handbook presents a number of pantheons (loose 
groupings of deities not united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for 
use in your game, including the gods of established D&amp;D worlds and 
fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of these pantheons for 
your campaign, or pick and choose deities and ideas from them as you 
please. See "A Sample Pantheon" in this section for an example. As far 
as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't matter if your world has 
hundreds of deities or a church devoted to a single god. In rules terms,
 clerics choose domains, not deities, so your world can associate 
domains with deities in any way you choose.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="31" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Loose Pantheons</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p10</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Most
 D&amp;D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. A multitude of deities 
rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and 
competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe.
 People gather in public shrines to worship gods of life and wisdom, or 
meet in hidden places to venerate gods of deception or destruction. Each
 deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is responsible for advancing 
that portfolio. In the Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor 
who calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages them to 
spread the ideals of honorable warfare, chivalry, and justice in 
society. Even in the midst of his everlasting war with his brother 
Hextor, god of war and tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: 
war fought nobly and in the cause of justice.</p><p>People in most 
D&amp;D worlds are polytheistic, honoring deities of their own and 
acknowledging pantheons of other cultures. Individuals pay homage to 
various gods, regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a person
 might propitiate Umberlee before setting out to sea, join a communal 
feast to celebrate Chauntea at harvest time, and pray to Malar before 
going hunting.</p><p>Some individuals feel a calling to a particular 
deity's service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly devoted 
individuals become priests by setting up a shrine or helping to staff a 
holy site. Much more rarely, those who feel such a calling become 
clerics or paladins invested with the responsibility of true divine 
power.</p><p>Shrines and temples serve as community gathering points for
 religious rites and festivals. Priests at such sites relate stories of 
the gods, teach the ethics of their patron deities, offer advice and 
blessings, perform religious rites, and provide training in activities 
their deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several temples 
dedicated to individual gods important to the community, while smaller 
settlements might have a single shrine devoted to any gods the locals 
revere.</p><p>To quickly build a pantheon for your world, create a 
single god for each of the eight domains available to clerics: Death, 
Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can 
invent names and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities from
 other pantheons. This approach gives you a small pantheon that covers 
the most significant aspects of existence, and it's easy enough to 
extrapolate other areas of life each deity controls. The god of 
Knowledge, for example, might also be patron of magic and prophecy, 
while the god of Light could be the sun god and the god of time.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="32" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">A Sample Pantheon</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p11</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a pantheon assembled from 
mostly preexisting elements to suit the needs of a particular campaign. 
This is the default pantheon in the fourth edition <i>Player's Handbook (2008)</i>. The pantheon is summarized in the Dawn War Deities table.</p><p>This
 pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities and establishes them as 
universal gods. These gods include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, 
Moradin, Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and Corellon as 
gods of their respective portfolios, rather than as racial deities. The 
pantheon also includes the archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and 
tyranny.</p><p>Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, 
sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes from the Forgotten 
Realms. From Greyhawk come Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the 
Greek pantheon come Athena (renamed Erathis) and Tyche (renamed 
Avandra), though both are altered. Set (renamed Zehir) comes from the 
Egyptian pantheon. The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's Hel 
and Greyhawk's Wee Jas. That leaves three gods created from scratch: 
Ioun, Melora, and Torog.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="33">Dawn War Deities</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-3"

 your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods who are closely linked 
in a single religion, monotheistic religions (worship of a single 
deity), dualistic systems (centered on two opposing deities or forces), 
mystery cults (involving personal devotion to a single deity, usually as
 part of a pantheon system), animistic religions (revering the spirits 
inherent in nature), or even forces and philosophies that don't center 
on deities.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="35" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tight Pantheons</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p11</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>In
 contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses on a single 
religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities. 
Followers of a tight pantheon might favor one of its member deities over
 another, but they respect all the deities and honor them with 
sacrifices and prayer as appropriate.</p><p>The key trait to a tight 
pantheon is that its worshipers embrace a single ethos or dogma that 
includes all the deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to 
protect and guide their followers. You can think of a tight pantheon as 
similar to a family. One or two deities who lead the pantheon serve as 
parent figures, with the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of
 the culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple honors all 
members of the pantheon.</p><p>Most tight pantheons have one or more 
aberrant gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the priests of 
the pantheon as a whole. These are usually evil deities and enemies of 
the pantheon, such as the Greek Titans. These deities have cults of 
their own, attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship.</p><p>These
 cults resemble mystery cults, their members strictly devoted to their 
single god, though even members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the
 temples of the tight pantheon.</p><p>The Norse deities serve as an 
example of a tight pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father 
figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody important aspects of
 Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki and his devotees lurk in the shadows, 
sometimes aiding the other deities, and sometimes working against them 
with the pantheon's enemies.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="36" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mystery Cults</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p11</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 mystery cult is a secretive religious organization based on a ritual of
 initiation, in which the initiate is mystically identified with a god, 
or a handful of related gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, 
concerned with the initiate's relationship with the divine.</p><p>Sometimes
 a mystery cult is a type of worship within a pantheon. It acknowledges 
the myths and rituals of the pantheon, but presents its own myths and 
rites as primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might immerse
 themselves in a mystical relationship to a god who is part of a broadly
 worshiped pantheon.</p><p>A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its 
god, which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. The 
foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple and often involves a
 god's death and rising, or a journey to the underworld and a return. 
Mystery cults often revere sun and moon deities and agricultural 
deities—gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature.</p><p>The 
cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its foundation myth. 
Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps in order to share the god's 
ultimate fate. In the case of dying and rising gods, the symbolic death 
of the initiate represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth
 into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into a new life, 
remaining in the world of mortal affairs but feeling elevated to a 
higher sphere. The initiate is promised a place in the god's realm after
 death, but also experiences new meaning in life.</p></div><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="37" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Divine Rank</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p11</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>The
 divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized according to 
their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped on multiple worlds and have a
 different rank on each world, depending on their influence there.</p><p><b>Greater deities</b>
 are beyond mortal understanding. They can't be summoned, and they are 
almost always removed from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very
 rare occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but 
slaying a greater god's avatar has no effect on the god itself.</p><p><b>Lesser deities</b>
 are embodied somewhere in the planes. Some lesser deities live in the 
Material Plane, as does the unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten 
Realms and the titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others
 live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such deities can 
be encountered by mortals.</p><p><b>Quasi-deities</b> have a divine 
origin, but they don't hear or answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, 
or control aspects of mortal life. They are still immensely powerful 
beings, and in theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed 
enough worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: 
demigods, titans, and vestiges.</p><p><i>Demigods</i> are born from the 
union of a deity and a mortal being. They have some divine attributes, 
but their mortal parentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities.</p><p><i>Titans</i>
 are the divine creations of deities. They might be birthed from the 
union of two deities, manufactured on a divine forge, born from the 
blood spilled by a god, or otherwise brought about through divine will 
or substance.</p><p><i>Vestiges</i> are deities who have lost nearly all
 their worshipers and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. 
Esoteric rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on their 
latent power.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="38" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Monotheism</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p12</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Monotheistic
 religions revere only one deity, and in some cases, deny the existence 
of any other deity. If you introduce a monotheistic religion into your 
campaign, you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if they 
don't, other religions can exist side by side with the monotheistic 
religion. If these religions have clerics with spellcasting ability, 
their spells might be powered by the one true deity, by lesser spirits 
who aren't deities (possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials,
 fey, fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith.</p><p>The deity 
of a monotheistic religion has an extensive portfolio and is portrayed 
as the creator of everything, in control of everything, and concerned 
with every aspect of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers 
prayers and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what aspect of life
 is in need of divine assistance. Whether marching into war, setting off
 on a journey, or hoping to win someone's affections, the worshiper 
prays to the same god.</p><p>Some monotheistic religions describe 
different aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different 
aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics of that god 
focus on one aspect or the other, determining their domain access and 
possibly even their alignment on that basis. A cleric who venerates the 
Destroyer aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while one who 
worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life or Nature domains. In some 
monotheistic religions, clerics group themselves into distinct religious
 orders to differentiate clerics who choose different domains.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="39" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dualism</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p12</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 dualistic religion views the world as the stage for a conflict between 
two diametrically opposed deities or divine forces. Most often, the 
opposed forces are good and evil, or opposed deities representing those 
forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law and chaos are 
the fundamental opposites in a dualistic system. Life and death, light 
and darkness, matter and spirit, body and mind, health and illness, 
purity and defilement, positive energy and negative energy-the D&amp;D 
universe is full of polar opposites that could serve as the foundation 
for a dualistic religion. Whatever the terms in which the dualism is 
expressed, half of the pair is usually believed to be good-beneficial, 
desirable, or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not 
explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is expressed 
as the opposition between matter and spirit, the followers of that 
religion believe that one of the two (usually matter) is evil and the 
other (spirit) is good, and so seek to liberate their spirits from this 
material world and its evils through asceticism and contemplation.</p><p>Rare
 dualistic systems believe that the two opposing forces must remain in 
balance, always pulling away from each other but remaining bound 
together in creative tension.</p><p>In a cosmology defined by an eternal
 conflict between good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The
 majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship the deity or 
force identified as good. Worshipers of the good deity trust themselves 
to that god's power to protect them from the evil deity's minions. 
Because the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source of 
everything that is detrimental to existence, only the perverse and 
depraved worship this god. Monsters and fiends serve it, as do certain 
secretive cults. The myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that 
the good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the forces of 
evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't predetermined and 
work to promote their deity's victory.</p><p>Deities in a dualistic 
system maintain large portfolios. All aspects of existence reflect the 
dualistic struggle, and therefore all things can fall on one side or the
 other of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, and 
poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and famine, hatred, 
disease, and war belong to the evil deity.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="40" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Animism</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p12</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Animism
 is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of the natural world. In 
an animistic worldview, everything has a spirit, from the grandest 
mountain to the lowliest rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook,
 from the sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these 
objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, though some 
are more aware, alert, and intelligent than others. The most powerful 
spirits might even be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if 
not veneration.</p><p>Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one 
spirit over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices to 
different spirits at different times, as appropriate to the situation. A
 pious character might make daily prayers and offerings to ancestor 
spirits and the spirits of the house, regular petitions to important 
spirits such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional sacrifices 
of incense to location spirits such as the spirit of a forest, and 
sporadic prayers to a host of other spirits as well.</p><p>An animistic 
religion is very tolerant. Most spirits don't care to whom a character 
also offers sacrifices, as long as they receive the sacrifices and 
respect they are due. As new religions spread through animist lands, 
those religions typically win adherents but not converts. People 
incorporate new spirits and deities into their prayers without 
displacing the old ones. Contemplatives and scholars adopt complex 
philosophical systems and practices without changing their belief in and
 respect for the spirits they already venerate.</p><p>Animism functions 
as a large tight pantheon. Animist clerics serve the pantheon as a 
whole, and so can choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for 
that cleric.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="41" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Forces and Philosophies</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p13</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Not
 all divine powers need to be derived from deities. In some campaigns, 
believers hold enough conviction in their ideas about the universe that 
they gain magical power from that conviction. In other campaigns, 
impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods by granting power 
to mortals attuned to them. Just as druids and rangers can gain their 
spell ability from the force of nature rather than from a specific 
nature deity, some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to a 
god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and chivalry rather 
than a specific deity.</p><p>Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; 
they aren't beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept 
sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't necessarily 
exclusive of service to a deity. A person can be devoted to the 
philosophy of good and offer worship to various good deities, or revere 
the force of nature and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might
 be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal force. In a world 
that includes deities with demonstrable power (through their clerics), 
it's unusual for a philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although
 a common philosophical belief states that the deities are more like 
mortals than they would have mortals believe. According to such 
philosophies, the gods aren't truly immortal (just very long-lived), and
 mortals can attain divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the 
ultimate goal of some philosophies.</p><p>The power of a philosophy 
stems from the belief that mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only 
one person believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power on 
that person.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="42" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Humanoids and the Gods</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p13</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider range of beliefs and 
institutions than other races do. In many D&amp;D settings, orcs, elves,
 dwarves, goblins, and other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is 
expected that an orc will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of 
subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces a staggering 
variety of deities. Each human culture might have its own array of gods.</p><p>In
 most D&amp;D settings, there is no single god that can claim to have 
created humanity. Thus, the human proclivity for building institutions 
extends to religion. A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire 
kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that prophet's death, the 
religion might wax or wane, or the prophet's followers might turn 
against one another and found several competing religions.</p><p>In 
comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in stone. The dwarves of 
the Forgotten Realms identify Moradin as their creator. While individual
 dwarves might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are pledged 
to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His teachings and magic are so 
thoroughly ingrained in dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic
 shift to replace him.</p><p>With that in mind, consider the role of the
 gods in your world and their ties to different humanoid races. Does 
each race have a creator god? How does that god shape that race's 
culture? Are other folk free of such divine ties and free to worship as 
they wish? Has a race turned against the god that created it? Has a new 
race appeared, created by a god within the past few years? A deity might
 also have ties to a kingdom, noble line, or other cultural institution.
 With the death of the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine 
portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in its earliest 
days. In such a land, the worship of other gods might be outlawed or 
tightly controlled.</p><p>Finally, consider the difference between gods 
who are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with more diverse 
followers. Do the races with their own pantheons enjoy a place of 
privilege in your world, with their gods taking an active role in their 
affairs? Are the other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the
 deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor of one god 
or another?</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="43" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mapping Your Campaign</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 creating the world where your campaign takes place, you'll want a map. 
You can take one of two approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some 
DMs like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the world at 
the start of the campaign by having a map that shows whole continents, 
and then zooming in on smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the 
opposite direction, starting with a small campaign area that is mapped 
at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming out as adventures take the 
characters into new territory. Whichever approach you take, hexes work 
well for mapping outdoor environments where travel can go in any 
direction and calculating distance might be important. A single sheet of
 hex paper with 5 hexes to the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale 
for your map that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter
 7 offers more information about creating and mapping wilderness areas.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="44" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Province Scale</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>For
 the most detailed areas of your world, use a province scale where each 
hex represents 1 mile. A full-page map at this scale represents an area 
that can be covered in one day's travel in any direction from the center
 of the map, assuming clear terrain. As such, province scale is a useful
 scale for mapping a campaign's starting area (see "Creating a 
Campaign," later in this chapter) or any location where you expect to 
track the adventurers' movement in hours rather than days.</p><p>The 
ground cover of an area this size will include broad stretches of one 
predominant terrain type, broken up by other isolated terrain types.</p><p>A
 settled region mapped at this scale might have one town and eight to 
twelve villages or farming hamlets. A wilder region might have only a 
single keep, or no settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent 
of the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. On a 
province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few hexes wide 
surrounding each town or village. Even small villages farm most of the 
arable land within a mile or two.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="45" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Kingdom Scale</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>On
 a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. A map at this scale 
covers a large region, about the size of Great Britain or half the size 
of the state of California. That's plenty of room for adventuring.</p><p>The
 first step of mapping a region at this scale is to sketch out the 
coastlines and any major bodies of water in the area. Is the region 
landlocked or on a coast? A coastal region might include islands 
offshore, and a landlocked area might include an inland sea or major 
lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single large island,
 or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple coastlines. Next, sketch in 
any major mountain ranges. Foothills form a transition between the 
mountains and lowlands, and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the 
region. That leaves the rest of your map for relatively flat terrain: 
grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place these elements as you 
see fit.</p><p>Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through the 
area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas that see a lot of 
rainfall, winding down to the nearest major body of water that doesn't 
require the river to cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join 
rivers as they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea.</p><p>Finally,
 place the major towns and cities of the region. At this scale, you 
don't need to worry about small towns and villages, or about mapping 
every belt of farmland. Even so, a settled region this size might easily
 have eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="46" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Continent Scale</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>For
 mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 1 hex represents 60 miles.
 At this scale, you can't see more than the shape of coastlines, the 
biggest mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political 
boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how multiple 
kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than tracking the movement of 
adventurers day by day.</p><p>The same process you use for mapping a 
region at kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. A continent
 might have eight to twelve large cities that deserve a place on the 
map, most likely major trade centers and the capitals of kingdoms.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="47" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Combining Scales</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Whichever
 scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or out on your maps. At 
continent scale, 1 hex represents the same area as 10 kingdom-scale 
hexes. Two cities that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent 
map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, and might define the 
opposite ends of the region you're detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex 
equals 6 province-scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by
 your province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale map and 
create interesting areas around it.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="48" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Settlements</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p15</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 places where people live-bustling cities, prosperous towns, and tiny 
villages nestled among miles of farmland-help define the nature of 
civilization in your world. A single settlement—a home base for your 
adventurers-is a great place to start a campaign and begin your world 
building. Consider the following questions as you create any settlement 
in your world:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">"What purpose does it serve in your game?"</li><li class="rd__li ">How big is it? Who lives there?</li><li class="rd__li ">What does it look, smell, and sound like?</li><li class="rd__li ">Who governs it? Who else holds power?

 guidelines in this section are here to help you build the settlement 
you want for whatever purpose you have in mind. Disregard any advice 
here that runs counter to your vision for a settlement.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="49" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Purpose</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p15</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story and fun of your 
campaign. Other than that point, the settlement's purpose determines the
 amount of detail you put into it. Create only the features of a 
settlement that you know you'll need, along with notes on general 
features. Then allow the place to grow organically as the adventurers 
interact with more and more of it, keeping notes on new places you 
invent.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="50" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Local Color</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p15</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 settlement might serve as a place where the characters stop to rest and
 to buy supplies. A settlement of this sort needs no more than a brief 
description. Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is, add a 
dash of flavor ("The smell of the local tanneries never lifts from this 
town"), and let the adventurers get on with their business. The history 
of the inn where the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the 
shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this level of detail, but 
you don't have to. If the characters return to the same settlement,

 settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, train, and recuperate
 between adventures. An entire campaign can center on a particular town 
or city. Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the 
characters go out into the wider world.</p><p>Designed well, a home base
 can hold a special place in the adventurers' hearts, particularly if 
they care about one or more NPCs who live there.</p><p>To make a home 
base come alive, you'll need to invest some time fleshing out details, 
but the players can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit 
about mentors, family members, and other important people in their 
characters' lives. Feel free to add to and modify what they give you, 
but you'll start with a solid foundation of the nonplayer characters 
(NPCs) who are important to the characters. Let the players describe 
where and how their characters spend their time—a favorite tavern, 
library, or temple, perhaps.</p><p>Using these NPCs and locations as a 
starting point, flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail 
its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed later in the 
chapter). Include characters who can provide information, such as sages,
 soothsayers, librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can provide 
spellcasting as well as information. Make note of merchants who might 
regularly interact with the adventurers and perhaps compete with one 
another for the party's business. Think about the people who run the 
adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful of wild cards: a 
shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired mercenary, a drunken rake, or 
anyone else who adds a dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="52" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adventure Site</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p16</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A

and who carry the responsibility for defending the villages from attack.

 do the adventurers first notice as they approach or enter a settlement?
 The towering wall bristling with soldiers? The beggars with hands 
outstretched, pleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of 
merchants and buyers thronging the market square? The overpowering 
stench of manure?</p><p>Sensory details help bring a settlement to life 
and vividly communicate its personality to your players. Settle on a 
single defining factor that sums up a settlement's personality and 
extrapolate from there.</p><p>Maybe a city is built around canals, like 
real-world Venice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory 
details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy waters, the sound
 of lapping waves and perhaps singing gondoliers, the smells of fish and
 waste polluting the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is
 shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the tendrils of cold
 mist reaching through every crack and cranny, the muffled sounds of 
hooves on cobblestones, the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense
 of mystery and lurking danger.</p><p>The climate and terrain of a 
settlement's environment, its origin and inhabitants, its government and
 political position, and its commercial importance all have a bearing on
 its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against the edge of a jungle has
 a very different feel than one on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf 
cities present a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to
 human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell any hint of 
dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city fostering an early 
system of democracy might boast an open-air market where philosophical 
ideas are traded as freely as produce. All the possible combinations of 
these factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of your 
campaign world.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="58" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Government</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p17</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 the feudal society common in most D&amp;D worlds, power and authority 
are concentrated in towns and cities. Nobles hold authority over the 
settlements where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect 
taxes from the populace, which they use for public building projects, to
 pay the soldiery, and to support a comfortable lifestyle for themselves
 (although nobles often have considerable hereditary wealth). In 
exchange, they promise to protect their citizens from threats such as 
orc marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving human bandits.</p><p>Nobles 
appoint officers as their agents in villages, to supervise the 
collection of taxes and serve as judges in disputes and criminal trials.
 These reeves, sheriffs, or bailiffs are commoners native to the 
villages they govern, chosen for their positions because they already 
hold the respect of their fellow citizens.</p><p>Within towns and 
cities, lords share authority and administrative responsibility with 
lesser nobles (usually their own relatives), and also with 
representatives of the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A 
lord mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or city council 
and to perform the same administrative functions that reeves carry out 
in villages. The council consists of representatives elected by the 
middle class.</p><p>Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their 
councils, since the economic power of the middle class is often more 
important to the prosperity of a town or city than the hereditary 
authority of the nobility.</p><p>The larger a settlement, the more 
likely that other individuals or organizations hold significant power 
there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual—a wise elder or a
 well-liked farmer-can wield more influence than the appointed reeve, 
and a wise reeve avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns and 
cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a prominent temple, a 
guild independent of the council, or an individual with magical power.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="59" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Forms of Government</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p18</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city might be a 
theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city governed by a merchant 
council. More likely, it's part of a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic 
empire, or a remote realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how 
your settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or region-who
 rules its ruler, and what other settlements might also lie under its 
control.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="60">Forms of Government</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 small villages can provide characters access to the gear they need to 
pursue their adventures. Provisions, tents, backpacks, and simple 
weapons are commonly available. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial
 weapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have inns that cater 
to travelers, where adventurers can find a hot meal and a bed, even if 
the quality leaves much to be desired.</p><p>Villages rely heavily on 
trade with other settlements, including larger towns and cities. 
Merchants pass through regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to 
the villagers, and any successful merchant has far-reaching contacts 
across the region. Traveling merchants pass on gossip and adventure 
hooks to the characters as they conduct their business. Since merchants 
make their living traversing roads that might be menaced by bandits or 
wandering monsters, they hire guards to keep their goods safe. They also
 carry news from town to town, including reports of situations that cry 
out for the attention of adventurers.</p><p>These merchants can't 
provide the services normally found in a city. For instance, when the 
characters are in need of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who 
can handle the griffon eggs they've found, or an architect to design 
their castle, they're better off going to a large city than looking in a
 village.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="82" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Currency</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p19</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 straightforward terms "gold piece" (gp), "silver piece" (sp), "copper 
piece" (cp), "electrum piece" (ep), and "platinum piece" (pp) are used 
throughout the game rules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations
 with more interesting descriptions in your game world. People give 
coins specific names, whether as plain as "dime" or lively as "gold 
double-eagle." A country typically mints its own currency, which might 
correspond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few currencies 
achieve widespread distribution, but nearly all coins are accepted 
worldwide-except by those looking to pick a fight with a foreigner.</p><p><b>Example: The Forgotten Realms</b></p><p>The
 world of the Forgotten Realms provides an extensive example of 
currencies. Although barter, blood notes, and similar letters of trade 
are common enough in Faerun, metal coins and trade bars are the everyday
 currency.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="83" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Common Coinage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p19</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Coins
 appear in a bewildering variety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials.
 Thanks to the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation's oddly shaped 
coins can be found throughout Faerun. In Sembia, square iron steel pence
 replace copper coins. Triangular silver pieces are ravens, 
diamond-shaped electrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called "blue 
eyes"), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia doesn't mint 
platinum coins. All coinage is accepted in Sembia, including copper and 
platinum pieces from abroad.</p><p>In Waterdeep, the bustling 
cosmopolitan center of trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are 
shards, electrum pieces are moons, gold pieces are dragons, and platinum
 coins are suns. The city's two local coins are the taol and the harbor 
moon. The taol is a square brass trading-coin pierced with a central 
hole to permit it to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in
 the city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor moon is a flat 
crescent of platinum with a central hole and an electrum inlay, named 
for its traditional use in the docks for buying large amounts of cargo 
at once. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp elsewhere.</p><p>The
 northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent-shaped, shining blue coin
 called an electrum moon, worth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. 
The city also issues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which looks 
like an electrum moon combined a darker silver wedge to form a round 
coin worth 5 ep within the city and 2 ep outside it.</p><p>The favored 
form of currency in the kingdom of Cormyr is the royal coinage of the 
court, stamped with a dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the
 other. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are silver falcons, 
electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces are golden lions, and 
platinum coins are tricrowns.</p><p>Even city-states mint their own 
copper, silver, and gold pieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer 
in these lands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other nations 
and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from certain lands (notably 
the wizard-dominated realms of Thay and Halruaa) use the currencies of 
other realms when trading abroad because their own coins and tokens are 
feared to be magically cursed, and so are shunned by others.</p><p>Conversely,
 the coins of long-lost, legendary lands and centers of great magic are 
honored, though those who find them are wise to sell them to collectors 
rather than merely spending them in markets. The coins of the old elven 
court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: thalvers (coppers), bedoars
 (silvers), thammarchs (electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils 
(platinum). These coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still used in 
trade among elves.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="84" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Trade Bars.</span></span> <p>Large
 numbers of coins can be difficult to transport and account for. Many 
merchants prefer to use trade bars-ingots of precious metals and alloys 
(usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone. Trade bars 
are stamped or graven with the symbol of the trading company or 
government that originally crafted them. These bars are valued by 
weight, as follows:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">A 2-pound silver bar is worth 10 gp and is about 5 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick.</li><li class="rd__li ">A 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick.</li><li class="rd__li ">A 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the size of a 2-pound silver bar.</li></ul><p>The
 city of Baldur's Gate mints large numbers of silver trade bars and sets
 the standard for this form of currency. The city of Mirabar issues 
black iron spindle-shaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about 2 
pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less in nearby trade 
centers, and as iron is normally valued elsewhere (1 sp per pound).</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="85" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Odd Currency.</span></span> <p>Coins
 and bars aren't the only forms of hard currency. Gond bells are small 
brass bells worth 10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar 
rings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded onto strings by the
 nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp per slice.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="86" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating Your Own</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p20</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As
 shown in the previous examples, currency doesn't need to obey a 
universal standard in your world. Each country and era can have its own 
coins with its own values. Your adventurers might travel through many 
different lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding six hundred 
ancient bedoars from the rule of Coronal Eltargrim twelve centuries 
before offers a deeper sense of immersion in your world than finding 60 
sp.</p><p>Varying names and descriptions of coins for the major 
contemporary and historical realms of your world adds an additional 
layer of texture. The golden lions of Cormyr convey the noble nature of 
that kingdom. If a nation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic 
faces and called torments, that currency expresses a distinct flavor.</p><p>Creating
 new coins connected to specific locations, like the taols of Waterdeep 
or the eclipsed moons of Silverymoon, provides another level of detail. 
As long as you keep the value of these new coins simple (in other words,
 don't invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local flavor to key 
locations in your world without adding undue complexity.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="87" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Languages and Dialects</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p20</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 fleshing out your world, you can create new languages and dialects to 
reflect its unique geography and history. You can replace the default 
languages presented in the Player's Handbook with new ones, or split 
languages up into several different dialects.</p><p>In some worlds, 
regional differences might be much more important than racial ones. 
Perhaps all the dwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom speak
 a common language, which is completely different from that spoken in 
the neighboring kingdom. This might make communication (and diplomacy) 
between two kingdoms significantly more difficult.</p><p>Widely used 
languages might have ancient versions, or there might be completely 
different ancient tongues that adventurers find written in tombs and 
ruins. Such languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions and 
tomes that characters encounter.</p><p>You might invent additional 
secret languages, besides Druidic and thieves' cant, that allow members 
of certain organizations or political affiliations to communicate. You 
could even decide that each alignment has its own language, which might 
be more of an argot used primarily to discuss philosophical concepts.</p><p>In
 a region where one race has subjugated another, the language of the 
conquerors can become a mark of social status. Similarly, reading and 
writing might be restricted by law to the upper classes of a society.</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="88" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Factions and Organizations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p21</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Temples,
 guilds, orders, secret societies, and colleges are important forces in 
the social order of any civilization. Their influence might stretch 
across multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly 
wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can play an important 
part in the lives of player characters, becoming their patrons, allies, 
or enemies just like individual nonplayer characters. When characters 
join these organizations, they become part of something larger than 
themselves, which can give their adventures a context in the wider 
world.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="89" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adventurers and Organizations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p21</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>At
 the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great way to connect 
adventurers to your world. As the game progresses, though, background 
ties often become less important.</p><p>Factions and organizations aimed
 at player characters are a way to keep higher-level adventurers 
connected to your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear agenda 
beyond individual gain. In the same way, villainous organizations create
 an ongoing sense of menace above and beyond the threat of solitary 
foes.</p><p>Having different characters tied to different factions can 
create interesting situations at the gaming table, as long as those 
factions have similar goals and don't work in opposition to one another 
all the time. Adventurers representing different factions might have 
competing interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals.</p><p>Adventurer
 organizations are also a great source of special rewards beyond 
experience points and treasure. Increased standing in an organization 
has value in and of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits 
such as access to an organization's information, equipment, magic, and 
other resources.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="90" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating Factions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p21</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Factions
 and organizations that you create for your campaign should grow out of 
the stories that are important to the world. Create organizations that 
your players will want to interact with, whether as allies, members, or 
enemies.</p><p>As a starting point, decide what role you want an 
organization to play in the world. What is it all about? What are its 
goals? Who founded it and why? What do its members do? Answering these 
questions should give you a good sense of the organization's 
personality. From there, think about typical members. How might people 
describe them? What are the typical members' classes and alignments? 
What personality traits do they tend to share?</p><p>Choosing a symbol 
and a motto for the organization is a way of summing up the work you've 
done so far. A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a very 
different personality from one that uses a winged viper. For a motto, 
choose not just a message but also a tone and style of speech that fits 
the organization as you've defined it. Consider the motto of the 
Harpers: "Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." The Harpers
 have a straightforward message of freedom and prosperity. Contrast that
 with the motto of a group of politically allied cities in the North 
calling themselves the Lords' Alliance: "Threats to home must be 
terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our security." These are 
sophisticated people involved in a delicate political alliance, with 
more emphasis on stability than on fairness and equality.</p><p>Finally,
 think about the ways that player characters might come into contact 
with the organization. Who are the important members-not just the 
leaders, but the agents in the field that the adventurers might 
encounter? Where are they active, and where do they have headquarters or
 strongholds? If adventurers do join, what kind of missions might they 
be sent on? What rewards can they gain?</p></div><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="91" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Sample Faction: The Harpers</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p21</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>The

 is an optional rule you can use to track an adventurer's standing

 that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and 
reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a 
character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization 
and access to resources.</p><p>A player tracks renown separately for 
each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an 
adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within 
another, based on the character's interaction with each organization 
over the course of the campaign.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="102" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gaining Renown</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p22</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an 
organization's interests or involve the organization directly. You award
 renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or 
quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.</p><p>Advancing
 an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that 
organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that 
organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the
 character's renown by 2 instead.</p><p>For example, characters with 
connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in 
which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the 
order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's 
renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a 
mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, 
completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2,
 showing the adventurers as effective allies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 
party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's 
hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You 
might increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this 
action directly increased that group's power and wealth, even though the
 task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="103" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Benefits of Renown</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p22</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The

 a character's renown within an organization grows, members of that 
organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You
 can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization's 
members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For 
example, members of the Emerald Enclave—a faction dedicated to 
preserving the natural order—might be less friendly toward characters 
who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, 
becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown 
within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds apply only to the default 
attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren't 
automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that 
character's renown—or perhaps because of it.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="107" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Perks.</span></span> <p>Earning
 a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined 
by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact

discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a 
follower (see chapter 4, "Creating Nonplayer Characters"), access to 
potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on 
dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a 
small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful 
spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of lower rank.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="108" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Downtime Activities.</span></span> <p>You

 a few alterations, the renown system can also serve as a measure of a 
character's link to the gods. It's a great option for campaigns where 
the gods take active roles in the world.</p><p>Using this approach, you 
track renown based on specific divine figures in your campaign. Each 
character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with 
goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she 
earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her 
gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos. A 
character loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring them, 
defiling their temples, and foiling their aims.</p><p>The gods bestow 
favors on those who prove their devotion. With each rank of piety 
gained, a character can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor 
usually comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor often 
comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for example, a character 
dedicated to Thor might receive a spell accompanied by the boom of 
thunder.</p><p>A high level of piety can also lead to a character 
gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a blessing or charm 
(see chapter 7, "Treasure," for such supernatural gifts).</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="111" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Magic in Your World</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p23</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 most D&amp;D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous and sometimes 
frightening. People everywhere know about magic, and most people see 
evidence of it at some point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and
 moves through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, the 
mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched by the gods, creatures
 born with supernatural power, and individuals who study the secrets of 
the multiverse. Histories and fireside tales are filled with the 
exploits of those who wield it.</p><p>What normal folk know of magic 
depends on where they live and whether they know characters who practice
 magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not have seen true magic 
used for generations and speak in whispers of the strange powers of the 
old hermit living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep in the 
Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors 
is a guild of wizards. These arcanists wish to make wizardry more 
accessible so the order's members can profit from selling their 
services.</p><p>Some D&amp;D settings have more magic in them than 
others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun setting, arcane magic 
is a hated practice that can drain life from the world. Much of Athas's 
magic lies in the hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of 
Eberron, magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. Mercantile 
houses sell magic items and services to anyone who can afford them. 
People purchase tickets to ride airships and trains propelled by 
elemental magic.</p><p>Consider these questions when fitting magic into your world:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Is some magic common? Is some socially unacceptable? Which magic is rare?</li><li class="rd__li ">How unusual are members of each spellcasting class? How common are those who can cast high-level spells?</li><li class="rd__li ">How
 rare are magic items, magical locations, and creatures that have 
supernatural powers? At what power level do these things go from 
everyday to exotic?</li><li class="rd__li ">How do authorities regulate and use magic? How do normal folks use magic and protect themselves from it?</li></ul><p>The
 answers to some questions suggest the answers to others. For example, 
if spellcasters of low-level spells are common, as in Eberron, then 
authorities and common folk are more likely to have access to and use 
the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic isn't only 
possible, but also less expensive. People are more likely to keep 
well-known magic in mind, and to protect against it, especially in risky
 situations.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="112" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Restrictions on Magic</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p24</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Some
 civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use of magic. 
Spellcasting might be forbidden without a license or official 
permission. In such a place, magic items and continual magical effects 
are rare, with protections against magic being the exception.</p><p>Some
 localities might prohibit specific spells. It could be a crime to cast 
any spells used to steal or swindle, such as those that bestow 
invisibility or produce illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate 
others are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of free will.
 Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for obvious reasons. A 
local ruler could have a phobia about a specific effect or spell (such 
as shapeshifting effects if he or she were afraid of being impersonated)
 and enact a law restricting that type of magic.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="113" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Schools of Magic</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p24</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 rules of the game refer to the schools of magic (abjuration, illusion, 
necromancy, and so on), but it's up to you to determine what those 
schools signify in your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest 
the existence of magic-using organizations in the world—bardic colleges 
and druid circles-which are up to you to flesh out.</p><p>You could 
decide that no formal structures like these exist in your world. Wizards
 (and bards and druids) might be so rare that a player character learns 
from a single mentor and never meets another character of the same 
class, in which case wizards would learn their school specialization 
without any formal training.</p><p>However, if magic is more common, 
academies can be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These 
institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, regulations, and 
procedures. For example, Materros the necromancer could be a brother of 
the necromantic Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within
 its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green robes of a 
master. Of course, when he wears these robes, his occupation is easily 
identified by those who know of the cabal. This recognition could be a 
boon or a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome 
reputation.</p><p>If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, 
bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, using the 
guidelines for organizations presented earlier in this chapter. A player
 character necromancer might cultivate renown within the Cabal of 
Thar-Zad, while a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of 
Mac-Fuirmidh.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="114" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Teleportation Circles</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p24</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 presence of permanent teleportation circles in major cities helps 
cement their important place in the economy of a fantasy world. Spells 
such as plane shift, teleport, and teleportation circle connect with 
these circles, which are found in temples, academies, the headquarters 
of arcane organizations, and prominent civic locations. However, since 
every teleportation circle is a possible means of entry into a city, 
they're guarded by military and magical protection.</p><p>As you design a
 fantasy city, think about the teleportation circles it might contain 
and which ones adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers 
commonly return to their home base by means of a teleportation circle, 
use that circle as a hook for plot developments in your campaign. What 
do the adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and find 
all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying in pools of blood? What
 if their arrival interrupts an argument between two feuding priests at 
the temple? Adventure ensues!</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="115" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Bringing Back the Dead</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p24</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, 
travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where 
the creature's deity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, 
its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing 
someone back from the dead means retrieving the soul from that plane and
 returning it to its body.</p><p>Enemies can take steps to make it more 
difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body
 prevents others from using raise dead or resurrection to restore the 
slain character to life.</p><p>A soul can't be returned to life if it 
doesn't wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity 
(if any) of the character attempting to revive it and might refuse to 
return on that basis. For example, if the honorable knight Sturm 
Brightblade is slain and a high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil 
dragons) grabs his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the dead
 by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him automatically fail. If the
 evil cleric wants to revive Sturm to interrogate him, she needs to find
 some way to trick his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising 
him and then capturing him once he is alive again.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="116" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating a Campaign</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p25</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 world you create is the stage for the adventures you set in it. You 
don't have to give more thought to it than that. You can run adventures 
in an episodic format, with the characters as the only common element, 
and also weave themes throughout those adventures to build a greater 
saga of the characters' achievements in the world.</p><p>Planning an 
entire campaign might seem like a daunting task, but you don't have to 
plot out every detail right from the start. You can start with the 
basics, running a few adventures, and think about larger plot lines you 
want to explore as the campaign progresses. You're free to add as much 
or as little detail as you wish.</p><p>The start of a campaign resembles
 the start of an adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, 
show the players that adventure awaits, and grab their attention right 
away. Give the players enough information to make them want to come back
 week after week to see how the story plays out.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="117" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Start Small</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p25</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 you first start building your campaign, start small. The characters 
need to know only about the city, town, or village where they start the 
game, and perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that the barony 
is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a distant forest is crawling with
 ettercaps and giant spiders, and you should note these things. But at 
the start of the game, the local area is enough to get the campaign off 
the ground. Follow these steps to create that local area:</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="118" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">1.

 the "Settlements" section earlier in this chapter for guidance on 
building this settlement. A small town or village at the edge of the 
wilderness serves as a fine home base in most D&amp;D campaigns. Use a 
larger town or city if you want a campaign with urban adventuring.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="119" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">2.

 "Mapping the Campaign" earlier in this chapter for guidance. Draw a map
 at province scale (1 hex = 1 mile) with the home base near the center. 
Fill in the area within a day's travel-about 25 to 30 miles-of the home 
base. Pepper it with two to four dungeons or similar adventure locales. 
An area that size is likely to have one to three additional settlements 
as well as the home base, so give thought to them as well.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="120" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">3.

See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for guidance.</p><p>A
 home base provides a common starting location for the characters. This 
starting point might be the village where they grew up or a city that 
attracted them from points beyond. Or perhaps they begin the campaign in
 the dungeons of an evil baron's castle where they've been locked up for
 various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing them into the midst
 of the adventure.</p><p>For each of these steps, give the locations 
only as much detail as they need. You don't need to identify every 
building in a village or label every street in a large city. If the 
characters start in the baron's dungeon, you'll need the details of this
 first adventure site, but you don't have to name all the baron's 
knights. Sketch out a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and 
consider whom the characters are most likely to interact with early in 
the campaign. Most important, visualize how this area fits into the 
theme and story you have in mind for your campaign. Then start working 
on your first adventure!</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="121" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Set the Stage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p26</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As
 you start to develop your campaign, you'll need to fill in the players 
on the basics. For easy distribution, compile essential information into
 a campaign handout. Such a handout typically includes the following 
material:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Any restrictions or new options for character creation, such as new or prohibited races.</li><li class="rd__li ">Any
 information in the backstory of your campaign that the characters would
 know about. If you have a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, 
this information could include seeds hinting at that focus.</li><li class="rd__li ">Basic
 information about the area where the characters are starting, such as 
the name of the town, important locations in and around it, prominent 
NPCs they'd know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble that's 
brewing.</li></ul><p>Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages
 is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of creative energy 
that produces twenty pages of great background material, save it for 
your adventures. Let the players uncover the details gradually in play.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="122" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Involving the Characters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p26</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Once
 you've identified what your campaign is about, let the players help 
tell the story by deciding how their characters are involved. This is 
their opportunity to tie their characters' history and background to the
 campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the various elements of
 each character's background tie into the campaign's story. For example,
 what secret has the hermit character learned? What is the status of the
 noble character's family? What is the folk hero's destiny?</p><p>Some 
players might have trouble coming up with ideas-not everyone is equally 
inventive. You can help spur their creativity with a few questions about
 their characters:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, who's your family? What's your current occupation?</li><li class="rd__li ">Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? Why did you come to this area?</li><li class="rd__li ">Are
 you tied to any of the organizations or people involved in the events 
that kick off the campaign? Are they friends or enemies?</li></ul></div><p>Listen
 to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can. Even if you want all the
 characters to have grown up in the starting town, consider allowing a 
recent arrival or a transplant if the player's story is convincing 
enough. Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits 
your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign into that story.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="123" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating a Background</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p26</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Backgrounds
 are designed to root player characters in the world, and creating new 
backgrounds is a great way to introduce players to the special features 
of your world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, 
organizations, and historical events from your campaign are particularly
 strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain religion live as beggars 
supported by a pious populace, singing the tales of their deity's 
exploits to entertain and enlighten the faithful. You could create a 
mendicant priest background (or modify the acolyte background) to 
reflect these qualities. It could include musical instrument 
proficiency, and its feature probably involves receiving hospitality 
from the faithful.</p><p>Guidelines for creating a new background are provided in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop."</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="124" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Campaign Events</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p26</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Significant
 events in the history of a fantasy world tend toward immense upheavals:
 wars that pit the forces of good against evil in an epic confrontation,
 natural disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions of 
vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations of world leaders. 
These world-shaking events title the chapters of history.</p><p>In a 
D&amp;D game, such events provide the sparks that can ignite and sustain
 a campaign. The most common pitfall of serial stories without a set 
beginning, middle, and end is inertia. Like many television shows and 
comic-book series, a D&amp;D campaign runs the risk of retreading the 
same ground long after the enjoyment's gone. Just as actors or writers 
drift away from those other mediums, so can players-the actors and 
writers of a D&amp;D game. Games stagnate when the story meanders too 
long without a change in tone, when the same villains and similar 
adventures grow tiresome and predictable, and when the world doesn't 
change around the characters and in response to their actions.</p><p>World-shaking
 events force conflict. They set new events and power groups in motion. 
Their outcomes change the world by altering the tone of the setting in a
 meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your world in big, bold 
print. Change-especially change that occurs as a result of the 
characters' actions-keeps the story moving. If change is imperceptible, 
the actions of the characters lack significance. When the world becomes 
reliable, it's time to shake things up.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="125" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Putting Events in Motion</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p27</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>World-shaking
 events can happen at any time in a campaign or story arc, but the 
biggest incidents naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end of a 
story.</p><p>That placement reflects the structure of dramatic stories. 
At the beginning of a story, something happens to shake the 
protagonists' world and spur them into action. The characters take 
action to resolve their problems, but other forces oppose them. As they 
reach a significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict 
disrupts the characters' plans, shaking their world again; failure seems
 imminent. At the end of the story, they succeed or fail, and the world 
is shaken again by the way the characters changed it for good or ill.</p><p>At
 the beginning of a D&amp;D campaign, world-shaking events create 
instant adventure hooks and affect the characters' lives directly. In 
the middle, they make great turning points as the characters' fortunes 
reverse-rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near the end 
of a campaign, such events serve as excellent climactic episodes with 
far-reaching effects. They might even occur after the story has ended, 
as a result of the characters' actions.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="126" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">When Not to Shake It Up</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p27</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 constructing a narrative, beware of "false action," or action for its 
own sake. False action doesn't move a story forward, engage characters, 
or cause them to change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in
 which car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but do little more 
than inconvenience the characters and eventually bore the audience with 
their repetition and dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&amp;D campaigns
 fall into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters together 
one after another with little impact on the characters or the world. 
Thus, it's probably not in the DM's best interest to reorder the world 
every single time there's a lull in the action, lest world-shaking 
events become ordinary.</p><p>As a general rule, a campaign can sustain 
up to three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the beginning, 
one near the middle, and one near the end. Use as many small-scale 
events that disturb the bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, 
fiefs, duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every significant 
event shakes someone's world, after all, no matter how small that world 
might be. Let unexpected and terrible events regularly afflict the 
world's smaller territories, but unless your story demands it, save the 
large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most important moments 
of your campaign.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="127" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">World-Shaking Events</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p27</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You

 leaders are monarchs, nobles, and chiefs. Religious leaders include 
deities' avatars, high priests, and messiahs, as well as those in charge
 of monasteries and leaders of influential religious sects. Major 
military leaders control the armed forces of countries. They include 
military dictators, warlords, and the heads of a ruler's war council. 
Minor military leaders include the heads of local militias, gangs, and 
other martial organizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or 
underworld leader wields power through a network of spies, bribes, and 
black-market trade. On the smallest scale, these are local gang bosses, 
pirate captains, and brigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso 
whose work reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way people 
think: a prominent playwright, bard, or court fool in whose words, art, 
or performance the people perceive universal truth. On a smaller scale, 
this might be an influential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or 
sculptor.</p><p>A major leader in philosophy, learning, or magic is a 
genius philosopher, a counselor to emperors, an enlightened thinker, the
 head of the highest institution of learning in the world, or an 
archmage. A minor leader might be a local sage, seer, hedge wizard, wise
 elder, or teacher.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="131" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Rise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era.</span></span> <p>In
 dramatic stories, a new leader's rise often comes at the end of a 
period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it's a war or uprising; other 
times it's an election, the death of a tyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or 
the appointment of a hero. Conversely, the new leader might be a tyrant,
 a fiend, or black-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could

 one thing that has been consistently true about the world, which is now
 no longer true due to this leader's rise or influence. This is the 
biggest change that occurs when the new leader takes power and becomes 
the prevailing trait that defines the era, the characteristic for which 
it is remembered.</li><li class="rd__li ">Name the person (or people) 
whose death, defeat, or loss opened the door for this leader to take 
power. This might be a military defeat, the overthrow of old ideas, a 
cultural rebirth, or something else. Who died, lost, or was defeated? 
What weren't they willing to compromise? Was the new leader complicit in
 the death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity serendipitous?</li><li class="rd__li ">Despite
 the leader's virtues, one flaw in particular outrages a certain segment
 of the populace. What is that flaw? What person or group of persons 
will do their utmost to foil this leader because of it? Conversely, what
 is this leader's greatest virtue, and who rises to the leader's defense
 because of it?</li><li class="rd__li ">Who believes in this leader now,
 but still retains doubts? This is someone close to the leader, who has 
the leader's trust and knows his or her secret fears, doubts, or vices.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="132" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Fall of a Leader, End of an Era.</span></span> <p>All
 that begins must end. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of 
the world are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become all the rage, and
 old ones fall out of favor. The attitude of the citizens toward their 
fallen leader shifts subtly at first and then changes dramatically as 
they look back or reminisce about the time before. The fallen leader 
might have been a benevolent ruler, an influential citizen, or even an 
adversary to the characters. How does the death of this person affect

 of the disasters on the table might not make immediate sense in the 
context of your campaign world. A flood in the desert? A volcanic 
eruption on grassy plains? If you randomly determine a disaster that 
conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the challenge of 
justifying the catastrophe can produce interesting results.</p><p>With 
two exceptions, the disasters on the table resemble those that affect 
our own world. Think of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear 
incidents; they're big events that unnaturally alter the land and its 
people. For example, in the Eberron campaign setting, a magical 
catastrophe lays waste to an entire country, transforming it into a 
hostile wasteland and ending the Last War.</p><p>Divine judgment is 
something else entirely. This disaster takes whatever form you want, but
 it's always a big, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity's displeasure.</p><p>You
 might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off the map of your 
world. A disaster ravages the land and effectively eliminates a place 
the characters once knew.</p><p>Leave one or two survivors to tell the 
characters what happened, and ensure that the characters feel the depth 
of the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this cataclysm? The 
following points can help you define the nature and consequences of the

 of new lands expand the map and change the boundaries of empires. 
Discoveries of new magic or technology expand the boundaries of what was
 once thought possible. New resources or archaeological finds create 
opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and power groups in motion to
 vie for their control.</p><p>A new discovery-or rediscovery-can impact 
your campaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the course of history 
and the events of the age. Think of this discovery as a big adventure 
hook or series of hooks. This is also an opportunity to create a unique 
monster, item, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the 
discovery matters, it doesn't have to be wholly original, just flavored 
for your campaign.</p><p>A discovery is particularly impressive when the
 adventurers in your campaign are the ones who make it. If they discover
 a new mineral with magical properties, map a new land that's eminently 
suitable for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with the power 
to wreak devastation on your world, they are likely to set major events 
in motion. This gives the players the opportunity to see exactly how

 the foretelling of a world-shaking event becomes a world-shaking event:
 an omen that predicts the fall of empires, the doom of races, and the 
end of the world. Sometimes an omen points to change for the good, such 
as the arrival of a legendary hero or savior. But the most dramatic 
prophecies warn of future tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike 
otherworld-shaking events, the outcome doesn't happen immediately. 
Instead, individuals or factions strive to fulfill or avert the 
prophecy-or shape the exact way it will be fulfilled-according to how it
 will affect them.</p><p>The prophecy's helpers or hinderers create 
adventure hooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A prophecy 
should foretell a big event on a grand scale, since it will take time to
 come true (or be averted).</p><p>Imagine that a world-shaking prophecy 
comes to light. If events continue on their present course, the prophecy
 will come true and the world will change dramatically as a result. 
Don't shy away from making this prophecy both significant and alarming, 
keeping in mind the following points:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Create
 a prophecy that foretells a major change to the campaign world. You can
 build one from scratch using ideas from the current campaign or 
randomly determine a world-shaking event and flesh out the details.</li><li class="rd__li ">Write
 a list of three or more omens that will occur before the prophecy comes
 to pass. You can use events that have already occurred in the campaign 
so that the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled. The rest are events 
that might or might not happen, depending on the actions of the 
characters.</li><li class="rd__li ">Describe the person or creature that
 discovered the prophecy and how it was found. What did this creature 
gain by revealing it? What did this person lose or sacrifice?</li><li class="rd__li ">Describe
 the individual or faction that supports the prophecy and works to 
ensure its fulfillment, and the one that will do all in its power to 
avert the prophecy. What is the first step each takes? Who suffers for 
their efforts?</li><li class="rd__li ">One part of the prophecy is 
wrong. Choose one of the omens you listed or one of the details you 
created for the world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The chosen 
omen is false, and if applicable, its opposite is true instead.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="145" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">10.

 wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called regular 
world-shaking events, mythic events exceed and surpass them. A mythic 
event might occur as the fulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten 
prophecy, or it might be an act of divine intervention.</p><p>Once again, your current campaign probably provides a few ideas for the shape of this event.

 rise or fall of a leader or era is the death or birth of a god, or the 
end of an age or the world. A cataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning 
deluge, an ice age, or a zombie apocalypse. An assault or invasion is a 
world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the awakening of a 
world-threatening monster, or the final clash between good and evil. A 
rebellion dethrones a god or gods, or raises a new force (such as a 
demon lord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning empire 
or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a doomsday device or a portal

 calendar lets you record the passage of time in the campaign. More 
importantly, it lets you plan ahead for the critical events that shake 
up the world. For simple time tracking, use a calendar for the current 
year in the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the 
campaign, and make note of the days that adventurers spend on their 
travels and various activities. The calendar tells you when the seasons 
change and the lunar cycle. More importantly, you can use your calendar 
to track important festivals and holidays, as well as key events that 
shape your campaign.</p><p>This method is a good starting point, but the
 calendar of your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you want 
to customize your calendar with details unique to your world, consider 
these types of features.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="147" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Basics</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p32</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 fantasy world's calendar doesn't have to mirror the modern one, but it 
can (see "The Calendar of Harptos" sidebar for an example). Do the weeks
 of a month have names? What about specific days of each month, like the
 ides, nones, and calends of the Roman calendar?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="148" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Physical Cycles</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p32</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Determine
 when the seasons fall, marked by the solstices and equinoxes. Do the

 holy days throughout your calendar. Each significant deity in your 
world should have at least one holy day during the year, and some gods' 
holy days correspond to celestial phenomena such as new moons or 
equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a god of 
agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or significant events in 
the history of the deity's worship, such as the birth or death of a holy
 person, the date of a god's manifestation, the accession of the current
 high priest, and so on.</p><p>Certain holy days are civic events, 
observed by every citizen of a town where a god's temple can be found. 
Harvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand scale. Other holy 
days are important only to people particularly devoted to a single 
deity. Still others are observed by priests, who perform private rites 
and sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific times of
 day. And some holy days are local, observed by the faithful of a 
specific temple.</p><p>Give some thought to how priests and common folk 
celebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a pew, and 
listening to a sermon is a mode of worship foreign to most fantasy 
religions. More commonly, celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The
 faithful bring animals to the temple to be slaughtered or burn incense 
as an offering. The wealthiest citizens bring the largest animals, to 
flaunt their wealth and demonstrate their piety. People pour out 
libations at the graves of their ancestors. They spend all-night vigils 
in darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a god's bounty.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="150" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Civic Observances</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p33</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Holy
 days provide the majority of the special celebrations in most 
calendars, but local or national festivals account for many others. The 
birthday of a monarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, 
craft festivals, market days, and similar events all provide excuses for
 local celebrations.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="151" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Fantastic Events</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p33</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Since
 your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane medieval society, add
 in a few events of an obviously magical nature. For example, perhaps a 
ghostly castle appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every 
year, or every third full moon fills lycanthropes with a particularly 
strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night of every month could mark 
the ghostly wanderings of a long-forgotten nomadic tribe.</p><p>Extraordinary
 events, such as the approach of a comet or a lunar eclipse, make good 
adventure elements, and you can drop them in your calendar wherever you 
want. Your calendar can tell you when there's a full moon for a lunar 
eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a particular effect.</p></div><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="152" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Calendar of Harptos</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p33</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>The

into twelve months of thirty days each, which roughly correspond to 
months in the real-world Gregorian calendar. Each month is divided into 
three tendays. Five special holidays fall between the months and mark 
the seasons. Another special holiday, Shieldmeet, is inserted into the 
calendar after Midsummer every four years, much like leap years in the 
modern Gregorian calendar.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><thead><tr><th class="col-4 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">Month</th><th class="col-4" data-rd-isroller="false">Name</th><th class="col-4" data-rd-isroller="false">Common Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">1</td><td class="col-4">Hammer</td><td class="col-4">Deepwinter</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center"></td><td class="col-4">Annual holiday: Midwinter</td><td class="col-4"></td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">2</td><td class="col-4">Alturiak</td><td class="col-4">The Claw of Winter</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">3</td><td class="col-4">Ches</td><td class="col-4">The Claw of the Sunsets</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">4</td><td class="col-4">Tarsakh</td><td class="col-4">The Claw of the Storms</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center"></td><td class="col-4">Annual holiday: Greengrass</td><td class="col-4"></td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">5</td><td class="col-4">Mirtul</td><td class="col-4">The Melting</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">6</td><td class="col-4">Kythorn</td><td class="col-4">The Time of Flowers</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">7</td><td class="col-4">Flamerule</td><td class="col-4">Summertide</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center"></td><td class="col-4">Annual holiday: Midsummer</td><td class="col-4"></td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center"></td><td class="col-4">Quadrennial holiday: Shieldmeet</td><td class="col-4"></td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">8</td><td class="col-4">Eleasias</td><td class="col-4">Highsun</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">9</td><td class="col-4">Eleint</td><td class="col-4">The Fading</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center"></td><td class="col-4">Annual holiday: Highharvesttide</td><td class="col-4"></td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">10</td><td class="col-4">Marpenoth</td><td class="col-4">Leaffall</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">11</td><td class="col-4">Uktar</td><td class="col-4">The Rotting</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center"></td><td class="col-4">Annual holiday: The Feast of the Moon</td><td class="col-4"></td></tr><tr><td class="col-4 text-center">12</td><td class="col-4">Nightal</td><td class="col-4">The Drawing Down</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="153" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ending a Campaign</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p33</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 campaign's ending should tie up all the threads of its beginning and 
middle, but you don't have to take a campaign all the way to 20th level 
for it to be satisfying. Wrap up the campaign whenever your story 
reaches its natural conclusion. Make sure you allow space and time near 
the end of your campaign for the characters to finish up any personal 
goals. Their own stories need to end in a satisfying way, just as the 
campaign story does. Ideally, some of the characters' individual goals 
will be fulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give 
characters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them before the very
 end.</p><p>Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. If you 
intend to run a new campaign for the same group of players, using their 
previous characters' actions as the basis of legends gives them 
immediate investment in the new setting. Let the new characters 
experience how the world has changed because of their old characters. In
 the end, though, the new campaign is a new story with new protagonists.

 building a new world (or adopting an existing one) and creating the key
 events that launch your campaign, you determined what your campaign is 
about. Next, you have to decide how you want to run your campaign.</p><p>What's
 the right way to run a campaign? That depends on your play style and 
the motivations of your players. Consider your players' tastes, your 
strengths as a DM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of 
game you want to run. Describe to the players how you envision the game 
experience and let them give you input. The game is theirs, too. Lay 
that groundwork early, so your players can make informed choices and 
help you maintain the type of game you want to run. Consider the 
following two exaggerated examples of play style.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="155" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Hack and Slash</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p34</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the monsters, and grab the 
treasure. This style of play is straightforward, fun, exciting, and 
action-oriented. The players spend relatively little time developing 
personas for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations or 
discussing anything other than the immediate dangers of the dungeon.</p><p>In
 such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil monsters and opponents 
and occasionally meet clearly good and helpful NPCs. Don't expect the 
adventurers to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate 
whether it's right or wrong to invade and wipe out a bugbear lair. Don't
 track money or time spent in town. Once they've completed a task, send 
the adventurers back into the action as quickly as possible. Character 
motivation need be no more developed than a desire to kill monsters and 
acquire treasure.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="156" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Immersive Storytelling</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p34</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Waterdeep
 is threatened by political turmoil. The adventurers must convince the 
Masked Lords, the city's secret rulers, to resolve their differences, 
but can do so only after both the characters and the lords have come to 
terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. This style of gaming is
 deep, complex, and challenging. The focus isn't on combat but on 
negotiations, political maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole
 game session might pass without a single attack roll.</p><p>In this 
style of game, the NPCs are as complex and richly detailed as the 
adventurers, although the focus lies on motivation and personality, not 
game statistics. Expect long digressions from each player about what his
 or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to ask a priest for 
advice can be as important an encounter as fighting orcs. (And don't 
expect the adventurers to fight the orcs at all unless they are 
motivated to do so.) A character will sometimes take actions against the
 player's better judgment, because "that's what the character would do."
 Since combat isn't the focus, game rules take a back seat to character 
development. Ability check modifiers and skill proficiencies take 
precedence over combat bonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to 
fit the players' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in part 3
 of this book.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="157" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Something in Between</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p34</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 style of play in most campaigns falls between these two extremes. 
There's plenty of action, but the campaign offers an ongoing storyline 
and interaction between characters as well. Players develop their 
characters' motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills in 
combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture of roleplaying 
encounters and combat encounters. Even in a dungeon setting, you can 
present NPCs that aren't meant to be fought but rather helped out, 
negotiated with, or just talked to.</p><p>Think about your preferred style of play by considering these questions:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or are you more focused on making the game seem like an action movie?</li><li class="rd__li ">Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines or modern thinking?</li><li class="rd__li ">Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor your goal?</li><li class="rd__li ">Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted or intense?</li><li class="rd__li ">Is bold action key, or do the players need to be thoughtful and cautious?</li><li class="rd__li ">Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you prefer improvising on the spot?</li><li class="rd__li ">Is the game full of varied D&amp;D elements, or does it center on a theme such as horror?</li><li class="rd__li ">Is the game for all ages, or does it involve mature themes?</li><li class="rd__li ">Are
 you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as allowing the characters 
to explore whether the end justifies the means? Or are you happier with 
straightforward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, and 
helping the downtrodden?</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="158" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">A World to Explore</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p34</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>Much
 of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from place to place, 
exploring the environment, and learning about the fantasy world. This 
exploration can take place in any environment, including a vast 
wilderness, a labyrinthine dungeon, the shadowy passages of the 
Underdark, the crowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of 
the sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a hidden object, 
investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, deciphering clues, solving
 puzzles, and bypassing or disabling traps can all be part of 
exploration.</p><p>Sometimes exploration is an incidental part of the 
game. For instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey by 
telling the players that they spend three uneventful days on the road 
before moving along to the next point of interest. Other times 
exploration is the focus, a chance to describe a wondrous part of the 
world or story that increases the players' feeling of immersion. 
Similarly, you should consider playing up exploration if your players 
enjoy solving puzzles, finding their way around obstacles, and searching
 dungeon corridors for secret doors.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="159" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Character Names</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p36</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Part
 of your campaign style has to do with naming characters. It's a good 
idea to establish some ground rules with your players at the start of a 
new campaign. In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, and 
Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, especially when he's 
identical to Bob I, who was killed by kobolds. If everyone takes a 
lighthearted approach to names, that's fine. If the group would rather 
take the characters and their names a little more seriously, urge Bob's 
player to come up with a more appropriate name.</p><p>Player character 
names should match each other in flavor or concept, and they should also
 match the flavor of your campaign world-so should the nonplayer 
characters' names and place names you create. Travok and Kairon don't 
want to undertake a quest for Lord Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or 
take down a crazy wizard named Ray.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="160" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Continuing or Episodic Campaigns</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p36</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 backbone of a campaign is a connected series of adventures, but you can
 connect them in two different ways. In a continuing campaign, the 
connected adventures share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring 
theme (or themes). The adventures might feature returning villains, 
grand conspiracies, or a single mastermind who's ultimately behind every
 adventure of the campaign.</p><p>A continuing campaign designed with a 
theme and a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. The 
players derive the satisfaction of knowing the actions they take during 
one adventure matter in the next. Plotting and running that kind of 
campaign can be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and 
memorable story.</p><p>An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a 
television show where each week's episode is a self-contained story that
 doesn't play into any overarching plot. It might be built on a premise 
that explains its nature: the player characters are 
adventurers-for-hire, or explorers venturing into the unknown and facing
 a string of unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, 
venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search of artifacts. An
 episodic game like this lets you create adventures-or buy published 
ones-and drop them into your campaign without worrying about how they 
fit with the adventures that came before and follow after.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="161" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Campaign Theme</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p36</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, expresses the deeper 
meaning of a story and the fundamental elements of human experience that
 the story explores. Your campaign doesn't have to be a work of 
literature, but it can still draw on common themes that lend a 
distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider these examples:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">A
 campaign about confronting the inevitability of mortality, whether 
embodied in undead monsters or expressed through the death of loved 
ones.</li><li class="rd__li ">A campaign revolving around an insidious 
evil, whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the yuan-ti, or 
creatures of unknown realms far removed from mortal concerns. As heroes 
confront this evil, they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their
 own kind as well.</li><li class="rd__li ">A campaign featuring troubled
 heroes who confront not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of 
the world, but also the beast within-the rage and fury that lies in 
their own hearts.</li><li class="rd__li ">A campaign exploring the 
insatiable thirst for power and domination, whether embodied by the 
hosts of the Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering the 
world.</li></ul><p>With a theme such as "confrontation with mortality," 
you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren't necessarily 
connected by a common villain. One adventure might feature the dead 
bursting from their graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. In
 the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh golem in an effort to 
revive his lost love. A villain could go to extreme lengths to achieve 
immortality to avoid confronting its own demise. The adventurers might 
help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the adventurers might 
even become a ghost!</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="162" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Variations on a Theme</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p36</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Mixing
 things up once in a while allows your players to enjoy a variety of 
adventures. Even a tightly themed campaign can stray now and then. If 
your campaign heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your 
players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl—especially if the 
tangent is revealed to relate to a larger plot in the campaign. If most 
of your adventures are dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense 
urban mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon crawl in an
 abandoned building or tower. If you run horror adventures week after 
week, try using a villain who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even 
silly. Comic relief is a great variation on almost any D&amp;D campaign,
 though players usually provide it themselves.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="163" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tiers of Play</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p36</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As
 characters grow in power, their ability to change the world around them
 grows with them. It helps to think ahead when creating your campaign to
 account for this change. As the characters make a greater impact on the
 world, they face greater danger whether they want to or not. Powerful 
factions see them as a threat and plot against them, while friendly ones
 court their favor in hopes of striking a useful alliance.</p><p>The 
tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for introducing new 
world-shaking events to the campaign. As the characters resolve one 
event, a new danger arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new 
threat in response to the characters' actions. Events need to grow in 
magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and drama as the characters 
become increasingly powerful.</p><p>This approach also allows you to 
break your design work down into smaller pieces. Create material such as
 adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at a time. You only need
 to worry about the details of the next tier as the characters approach 
it. Even better, as the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to 
the players' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing much work.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="164" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Levels 1-4: Local Heroes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p37</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Characters
 in this tier are still learning the range of class features that define
 them, including their choice of specialization. But even 1st-level 
characters are heroes, set apart from the common people by natural 
characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater destiny that 
lies before them.</p><p>At the start of their careers, characters use 
1st- and 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The magic items they 
find include common consumable items (potions and scrolls) and a very 
few uncommon permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in a 
single encounter, but it doesn't change the course of an adventure.</p><p>The
 fate of a village might hang on the success or failure of low-level 
adventurers, who trust their lives to their fledgling abilities. These 
characters navigate dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where 
they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, giant spiders, 
evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and hired thugs. If they face even a
 young dragon, they're better off avoiding a fight.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="165" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Levels 5-10: Heroes of the Realm</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p37</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>By

 more permanent magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which will
 serve them for the rest of their careers.</p><p>The fate of a region 
might depend on the adventures that characters of levels 5 to 10 
undertake. These adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient 
ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious hydras, fearless 
golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind 
flayers, and drow assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a

 at these levels have far-reaching consequences, possibly determining 
the fate of millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. 
Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore demiplanes and other
 extraplanar locales, where they fight savage balor demons, titans, 
archdevils, lich archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. The
 dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous power, whose sleep 
troubles kingdoms and whose waking threatens existence itself.</p><p>Characters
 who reach 20th level have attained the pinnacle of mortal achievement. 
Their deeds are recorded in the annals of history and recounted by bards
 for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to pass. A cleric might be
 taken up into the heavens to serve as a god's right hand. A warlock 
could become a patron to other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks the 
secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons exploring the 
farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid might become one with the 
land, transforming into a nature spirit of a particular place or an 
aspect of the wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties that
 revere the memory of their honored ancestors from generation to 
generation, create masterpieces of epic literature that are sung and 
retold for thousands of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep 
the adventurers' principles and dreams alive.</p><p>Reaching this point 
doesn't necessarily dictate the end of the campaign. These powerful 
characters might be called on to undertake grand adventures on the 
cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their capabilities 
can continue to evolve. Characters gain no more levels at this point, 
but they can still advance in meaningful ways and continue performing 
epic deeds that resound throughout the multiverse. Chapter 7 details 
epic boons you can use as rewards for these characters to maintain a 
sense of progress.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="168" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Starting at Higher Level</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p38</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Experienced

 &amp; Dragons is a fantasy game, but that broad category encompasses a 
lot of variety. Many different flavors of fantasy exist in fiction and 
film. Do you want a horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P. 
Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a world of muscled 
barbarians and nimble thieves, along the lines of the classic 
sword-and-sorcery books by Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your 
choice can have a impact on the flavor of your campaign.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="171" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Heroic Fantasy</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p38</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Heroic
 fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&amp;D rules. The Player's 
Handbook describes this baseline: a multitude of humanoid races coexist 
with humans in fantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to 
bear against the monstrous threats they face. These characters typically
 come from ordinary backgrounds, but something impels them into an 
adventuring life. The adventurers are the "heroes" of the campaign, but 
they might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for selfish 
reasons. Technology and society are based on medieval norms, though the 
culture isn't necessarily European. Campaigns often revolve around 
delving into ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to 
destroy monsters or villains.</p><p>This genre is also common in fantasy
 fiction. Most novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as 
heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the authors listed
 in appendix E of the Player's Handbook.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="172" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sword and Sorcery</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p38</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 grim, hulking fighter disembowels the high priest of the serpent god on
 his own altar. A laughing rogue spends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine 
in filthy taverns. Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle 
in search of the fabled City of Golden Masks.</p><p>A sword-and-sorcery 
campaign emulates some of the classic works of fantasy fiction, a 
tradition that goes back to the roots of the game. Here you'll find a 
dark, gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where the 
protagonists are motivated more by greed and self-interest than by 
altruistic virtue. Fighter, rogue, and barbarian characters tend to be 
far more common than wizards, clerics, or paladins. In such a pulp 
fantasy setting, those who wield magic often symbolize the decadence and
 corruption of civilization, and wizards are the classic villains of 
these settings. Magic items are therefore rare and often dangerous.</p><p>Certain
 Dungeons &amp; Dragons novels follow in the footsteps of classic 
sword-and-sorcery novels. The world of Athas (as featured in numerous 
Dark Sun novels and game products), with its heroic gladiators and 
tyrannical sorcerer-kings, belongs squarely in this genre.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="173" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Epic Fantasy</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p39</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A

 a quest to close the gate to the Nine Hells that has opened in the 
remote wilderness. A close-knit band of loyal friends strives to 
overcome the forces of a tyrannical overlord.</p><p>An epic-fantasy 
campaign emphasizes the conflict between good and evil as a prominent 
element of the game, with the adventurers more or less squarely on the 
side of good. These characters are heroes in the best sense, driven by a
 higher purpose than selfish gain or ambition, and facing incredible 
dangers without blinking. Characters might struggle with moral 
quandaries, fighting the evil tendencies within themselves as well as 
the evil that threatens the world. And the stories of these campaigns 
often include an element of romance: tragic affairs between star-crossed
 lovers, passion that transcends even death, and chaste adoration 
between devout knights and the monarchs and nobles they serve.</p><p>The novels of the Dragonlance saga exemplify the tradition of epic fantasy in D&amp;D.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="174" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mythic Fantasy</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p39</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>While

soul of her lost love. Calling on their divine parentage, a group of 
demigods undertake twelve labors to win the gods' blessings for other 
mortals.</p><p>A mythic-fantasy campaign draws on the themes and stories
 of ancient myth and legend, from Gilgamesh to Cu Chulainn. Adventurers 
attempt mighty feats of legend, aided or hindered by the gods or their 
agents—and they might have divine blood themselves. The monsters and 
villains they face probably have a similar origin. The minotaur in the 
dungeon isn't just another bull-headed humanoid, but <i>the</i> 
Minotaur-misbegotten offspring of a philandering god. Adventures might 
lead the heroes through a series of trials to the realms of the gods in 
search of a gift or favor.</p><p>Such a campaign can draw on the myths and legends of any culture, not just the familiar Greek tales.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="175" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dark Fantasy</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p40</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Vampires
 brood on the battlements of their accursed castles. Necromancers toil 
in dark dungeons to create horrid servants made of dead flesh. Devils 
corrupt the innocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these 
elements evoke horrific aspects of the fantasy genre.</p><p>If you want 
to put a horror spin on your campaign, you have plenty of material to 
work with. The Monster Manual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a
 storyline of supernatural horror. The most important element of such a 
campaign, though, isn't covered by the rules. A dark-fantasy setting 
requires an atmosphere of building dread, created through careful pacing
 and evocative description. Your players contribute too; they have to be
 willing to embrace the mood you're trying to evoke.</p><p>Whether you 
want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy campaign or a single creepy 
adventure, you should discuss your plans with the players ahead of time 
to make sure they're on board. Horror can be intense and personal, and 
not everyone is comfortable with such a game.</p><p>Novels and game products set in Ravenloft, the Demiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a D&amp;D context.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="176" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Intrigue</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p40</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

espionage, sabotage, and similar cloak-and-dagger activities can provide
 the basis for an exciting D&amp;D campaign. In this kind of game, the 
characters might care more about skill training and making contacts than
 about attack spells and magic weapons. Roleplaying and social 
interaction take on greater importance than combat, and the party might 
go for several sessions without seeing a monster.</p><p>Again, make sure
 your players know ahead of time that you want to run this kind of 
campaign. Otherwise, a player might create a defense-focused dwarf 
paladin, only to find he is out of place among half-elf diplomats and

into a magical slumber, and what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered
 the guildmaster, and how did the killer get into the guild's locked 
vault?</p><p>A mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in the role 
of investigators, perhaps traveling from town to town to crack tough 
cases the local authorities can't handle. Such a campaign emphasizes 
puzzles and problem-solving in addition to combat prowess.</p><p>A 
larger mystery might even set the stage for the whole campaign. Why did 
someone kill the characters' mentor, setting them on the path of 
adventure? Who really controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case, 
the characters might uncover clues to the greater mystery only once in a
 while; individual adventures might be at best tangentially related to 
that theme. A diet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so be 
sure to mix up the kinds of encounters you present.</p><p>Novels in various D&amp;D settings have explored the mystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular, <i>Murder in Cormyr</i> (by Chet Williamson), <i>Murder in Halruaa</i> (by Richard S. Meyers), and <i>Spellstorm</i> (by Ed Greenwood) are mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. <i>Murder in Tarsis</i> (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same approach in the Dragonlance setting.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="178" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Swashbuckling</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p40</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Rapier-wielding

waiting to devour treasure hunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins
 weave their way through palace intrigues and leap from balconies onto 
waiting horses below.</p><p>The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and 
musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic campaign. The characters 
typically spend more time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels
 than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills important (though not
 to the extent of a pure intrigue campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes 
might end up in classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm 
sewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke's hidden chambers.</p><p>A good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the Forgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild, who appears in novels by Richard Baker (<i>City of Ravens and Prince of Ravens</i>).</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="179" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p40</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A

 batter down the stronghold's walls and ramparts. Dragons wheel above a 
barbarian horde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors cut a swath 
through field and forest. Salamanders muster at an efreeti's command, 
poised to assault an astral fortress.</p><p>Warfare in a fantasy world 
is rife with opportunities for adventure. A war campaign isn't generally
 concerned with the specifics of troop movements, but instead focuses on
 the heroes whose actions turn the tide of battle. The characters carry 
out specific missions: capture a magical standard that empowers undead 
armies, gather reinforcements to break a siege, or cut through the 
enemy's flank to reach a demonic commander. In other situations, the 
party supports the larger army by holding a strategic location until 
reinforcements arrive, killing enemy scouts before they can report, or 
cutting off supply lines. Information gathering and diplomatic missions 
can supplement the more combat-oriented adventures.</p><p>The War of the
 Lance in the Dragonlance Chronicles novels and the War of the Spider 
Queen in the novel series of the same name are prominent examples of 
wars in D&amp;D novels.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="180" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Wuxia</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p41</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 a sensei disappears mysteriously, her young students must take her 
place and hunt down the oni terrorizing their village. Accomplished 
heroes, masters of their respective martial arts, return home to free 
their village from an evil hobgoblin warlord. The rakshasa master of a 
nearby monastery performs rituals to raise troubled ghosts from their 
rest.</p><p>A campaign that draws on elements of Asian martial-arts 
movies is a perfect match for D&amp;D. Players can define the appearance
 of their characters and gear however they like for the campaign, and 
spells need only minor flavor changes so that they better reflect such a
 setting. For example, when the characters use spells or special 
abilities that teleport them short distances, they actually make 
high-flying acrobatic leaps. Ability checks to climb don't involve 
careful searching for holds but let characters bounce up walls or from 
tree to tree. Warriors stun their opponents by striking pressure points.
 Flavorful descriptions of actions in the game don't change the nuts and
 bolts of the rules, but they make all the difference in the feel of a 
campaign.</p><p>Similarly, a class doesn't need new rules to reflect a 
cultural influence; a new name can do the trick. A traditional Chinese 
wuxia hero might be a paladin who has a sword called the Oath of 
Vengeance, while a Japanese samurai might be a paladin with a particular
 Oath of Devotion (bushido) that includes fealty to a lord (daimyo) 
among its tenets. A ninja is a monk who pursues the Way of Shadow. 
Whether called a wu jen, a tsukai, or a swami, a wizard, sorcerer, or 
warlock character works just fine in a game inspired by medieval Asian 
cultures.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="181">Wuxia Weapon Names</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-4" data-rd-isroller="false">Weapon</th><th class="col-8" data-rd-isroller="false">Other Names (Culture)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-4">Battleaxe</td><td class="col-8">fu (China), masakari (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Club</td><td class="col-8">bian (China), tonfa (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Dagger</td><td class="col-8">bishou, tamo (China), kozuka, tanto (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Dart</td><td class="col-8">shuriken (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Flail</td><td class="col-8">nunchaku (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Glaive</td><td class="col-8">guandao (China), bisento, naginata (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Greatclub</td><td class="col-8">tetsubo (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Greatsword</td><td class="col-8">changdao (China), nodachi (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Halberd</td><td class="col-8">ji (China), kamayari (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Handaxe</td><td class="col-8">ono (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Javelin</td><td class="col-8">mau (China), uchi-ne (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Lance</td><td class="col-8">umayari (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Longbow</td><td class="col-8">daikyu (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Longsword</td><td class="col-8">jian (China), katana (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Mace</td><td class="col-8">chui (China), kanabo (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Pike</td><td class="col-8">mao (China), nagaeyari (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Quarterstaff</td><td class="col-8">gun (China), bo (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Scimitar</td><td class="col-8">liuyedao (China), wakizashi (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Shortbow</td><td class="col-8">hankyu (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Shortsword</td><td class="col-8">shuangdao (China)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Sickle</td><td class="col-8">kama (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Spear</td><td class="col-8">qiang (China), yari (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Trident</td><td class="col-8">cha (China), magariyari (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Warpick</td><td class="col-8">fang (China), kuwa (Japan)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Having

 the assumed D&amp;D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. For 
your campaign, you decide what planes to include, inspired by the 
standard planes, drawn from Earth's myths, or created by your own 
imagination.</p><p>At minimum, most D&amp;D campaigns require these elements:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">A plane of origin for fiends</li><li class="rd__li ">A plane of origin for celestials</li><li class="rd__li ">A plane of origin for elementals</li><li class="rd__li ">A place for deities, which might include any or all of the previous three</li><li class="rd__li ">The place where mortal spirits go after death, which might include any or all of the first three</li><li class="rd__li ">A way of getting from one plane to another</li><li class="rd__li ">A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function</li></ul><p>Once
 you've decided on the planes you want to use in your campaign, putting 
them into a coherent cosmology is an optional step. Since the primary 
way of traveling from plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, 
is through magical portals that link planes together, the exact 
relationship of different planes to one another is largely a theoretical
 concern. No being in the multiverse can look down and see the planes in
 their arrangement the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No 
mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched between Bytopia 
and Arcadia, but it's a convenient theoretical construct based on the 
philosophical shading among the three planes and the relative importance
 they give to law and good.</p><p>Sages have constructed a few such 
theoretical models to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly 
the Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great Wheel, the World 
Tree, and the World Axis, but you can create or adapt whatever model 
works best for the planes you want to use in your game.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="187" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Inventing Your Own Planes</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p43</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>Each
 of the planes described in this chapter has at least one significant 
effect on travelers who venture there. When you design your own planes, 
it's a good idea to stick to that model. Create one simple trait that 
players notice, that doesn't create too much complication at the gaming 
table, and that's easy to remember. Try to reflect the philosophy and 
mood of the place, not merely its physical characteristics.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="188" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Great Wheel</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p44</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 default cosmological arrangement presented in the Player's Handbook 
visualizes the planes as a group of concentric wheels, with the Material
 Plane and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form a wheel 
around the Material Plane, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane. Then the 
Outer Planes form another wheel around and behind (or above or below) 
that one, arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands linking 
them all.</p><p>This arrangement makes sense of the way the River Styx 
flows among the Lower Planes, connecting Acheron, the Nine Hells, 
Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a 
string. But it's not the only possible explanation of the river's 
course.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="189" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The World Tree</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p44</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 different arrangement of planes envisions them situated among the roots
 and branches of a great cosmic tree, literally or figuratively.</p><p>For
 example, the Norse cosmology centers on the World Tree Yggdrasil. The 
three roots of the World Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer 
Plane that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other regions), 
Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim (the underworld). The 
Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, is a unique transitive plane that connects 
Asgard and Midgard.</p><p>Similarly, one vision of the planes where the 
deities of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of celestial 
planes in the branches of a World Tree, while the fiendish planes are 
linked by a River of Blood. Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each 
of these planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, though 
they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish creatures.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="190" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The World Axis</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p44</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>In
 this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its echoes stand 
between two opposing realms. The Astral Plane (or Astral Sea) floats 
above them, holding any number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). 
Below the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, 
undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements clash together. 
At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is the Abyss, like a hole torn in 
the fabric of the cosmos.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="191" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Other Visions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p44</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As you build your own cosmology, consider the following alternatives.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="192" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Omniverse.</span></span> <p>This

its ruler, mortal souls linger as insubstantial shades until they

particularly close: through caves, by sailing far across the sea, or in 
fairy rings in remote forests. It has dark, evil regions (homes of 
fiends and evil gods), sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits
 of the blessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This otherworld is
 sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or by four cities that each 
represent a different aspect of reality. The Celtic cosmology has an

 is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a 
specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some 
portals function like doorways, appearing as a clear window or a 
fog-shrouded passage, and interplanar travel is as simple as stepping 
through the doorway. Other portals are locations-circles of standing 
stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in
 multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another. Some are 
vortices, joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the
 Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of
 Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</p><p>Passing
 through a planar portal can be the simplest way to travel from the 
Material Plane to a desired location on another plane. Most of the time,
 though, a portal presents an adventure in itself.</p><p>First, the 
adventurers must find a portal that leads where they want to go. Most 
portals exist in distant locations, and a portal's location often has 
thematic similarities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal to
 the heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located on a mountain peak.</p><p>Second,
 portals often have guardians charged with ensuring that undesirable 
people don't pass through. Depending on the portal's destination, 
"undesirable people" might include evil characters, good characters, 
cowards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal creature. A 
portal's guardian is typically a powerful magical creature, such as a 
genie, sphinx, titan, or native of the portal's destination plane.</p><p>Finally,
 most portals don't stand open all the time, but open only in particular
 situations or when a certain requirement is met. A portal can have any 
conceivable requirement, but the following are the most common:</p><ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle"><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Time.</span>
 The portal functions only at particular times: during a full moon on 
the Material Plane, or every ten days, or when the stars are in a 
particular position. Once it opens, such a portal remains open for a 
limited time, such as for three days following the full moon, or for an 
hour, or for <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d4 + 1&quot;}">1d4 + 1</span> rounds.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Situation.</span>
 The portal functions only if a particular condition is met. A 
situation-keyed portal opens on a clear night, or when it rains, or when
 a certain spell is cast in its vicinity.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Random.</span>
 A random portal functions for a random period, then shuts down for a 
similarly random duration. Typically, such a portal allows <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d6 + 6&quot;}">1d6 + 6</span> travelers to pass through, then shuts down for <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 The portal functions only if a particular command word is spoken. 
Sometimes the word must be spoken as a character passes through the 
portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, window, or similar 
opening). Other portals open when the command word is spoken and remain 
open for a short time.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Key.</span>
 The portal functions if the traveler is holding a particular object; 
the item acts much like a key to a door. This key item can be a common 
object or a particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil 
above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors because it features an 
overwhelming number of such item-keyed portals.</p></li></ul><p>Learning
 and meeting a portal's requirements can draw characters into further 
adventures as they chase down a key item, scour old libraries for 
command words, or consult sages to find the right time to visit the 
portal.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="202" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Spells</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p46</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p class="rd__quote-line ">“<i>Sarya

 can directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with different 
degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the

 plane shift spell has two important limitations. The first is the 
material component: a small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) 
attuned to the desired planar destination. The spell requires the proper
 resonating frequency to home in on the correct location, and the fork 
must be made of the right material (sometimes a complex alloy) to focus 
the spell's magic properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250
 gp), but even the act of researching the correct specifications can 
lead to adventure. After all, not many people voluntarily travel into 
the depths of Carceri, so very few know what kind of tuning fork is 
required to get there.</p><p>Second, the spell doesn't send the caster 
to a specific location unless he or she has specialized information. The
 sigil sequence of a teleportation circle located on another plane 
allows the caster to travel directly to that circle, but such knowledge 
is even harder to come by than the specifications of the required tuning
 fork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to a location in the 
general vicinity of the desired spot. Wherever the adventurers arrive, 
they'll most likely still need to undertake a journey to reach the 
object of a planar quest.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="204" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gate</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p46</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The

 Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel 
as disembodied souls to reach the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery 
sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray 
streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most of the Astral 
Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors occasionally stumble upon the

 spell involves projecting one's consciousness there, usually in search 
of a gateway to an Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as 
much spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this allows a
 character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he or she had physically 
traveled there, but as in a dream.</p><p>A character's death-either in 
the Astral Plane or on the destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only
 the severing of a character's silver cord while on the Astral Plane (or
 the death of his or her helpless physical body on the Material Plane) 
can result in the character's true death. Thus, high-level characters 
sometimes travel to the Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather 
than seek out a portal or use a more direct spell.</p><p>Only a few 
things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the most common being a 
psychic wind (described below). The legendary silver swords of the

the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so
 that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the

feet. The plane's depths comprise a region of swirling mist and fog 
called the Deep Ethereal, where visibility is limited to 30 feet.</p><p>Characters
 can use the etherealness spell to enter the Border Ethereal. The plane 
shift spell allows transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep 
Ethereal, but unless the intended destination is a specific location or a
 teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be anywhere on the

 the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into whatever plane it 
overlaps, but that plane appears muted and indistinct, its colors 
blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens 
watch the plane as though peering through distorted and frosted glass, 
and can't see anything beyond 30 feet into the other plane. Conversely, 
the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the overlapped 
planes, except with the aid of magic.</p><p>Normally, creatures in the 
Border Ethereal can't attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice
 versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and utterly silent
 to someone on the overlapped plane, and solid objects on the overlapped
 plane don't hamper the movement of a creature in the Border Ethereal. 
The exceptions are certain magical effects (including anything made of 
magical force) and living beings. This makes the Ethereal Plane ideal 
for reconnaissance, spying on opponents, and moving around without being
 detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws of gravity; a

inhabited by sylvan creatures, such as elves, dryads, satyrs, pixies, 
and sprites, as well as centaurs and magical creatures such as blink 
dogs, faerie dragons, treants, and unicorns. The darker regions of the 
plane are home to such malevolent creatures as hags, blights, goblins, 
ogres, and giants.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="220" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Seelie and Unseelie Fey</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p49</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>Two
 queens hold court in the Feywild, and most fey owe allegiance to one or
 the other. Queen Titania and her Summer Court lead the seelie fey, and 
the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the 
unseelie fey.</p><p>Seelie and unseelie do not directly correlate with 
good and evil, though many mortals make that equation. Many seelie fey 
are good, and many unseelie are evil, but their opposition to each other
 stems from their queens' jealous rivalry, not abstract moral concerns. 
Ugly denizens of the Feywild, such as fomorians and hags, are almost 
never members of either court, and fey of independent spirit reject the 
courts entirely.</p><p>The courts have warred at times, but they also 
compete in more-or-less friendly contests and even ally with one another
 in small and secret ways.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="221" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Fey Crossings</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p50</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Fey
 crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the Material Plane that

 clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of mushrooms, or 
crawling under the trunk of a tree. To the traveler, it seems like he or
 she has simply walked into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the
 traveler is there one moment and gone the next.</p><p>Like other 
portals between planes, most fey crossings open infrequently. A crossing
 might open only during a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or
 for someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing can be 
closed permanently if the land on either side is dramatically 
altered-for example, if a castle is built over the clearing on the

 Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a dimension of black, 
gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything.
 It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a 
black vault with neither sun nor stars. The Shadowfell overlaps the 
Material Plane in much the same way as the Feywild. Aside from the 
colorless landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane.</p><p>Landmarks
 from the Material Plane are recognizable on the Shadowfell, but they 
are twisted and warped—distorted reflections of what exists on the 
Material Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, the 
corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged rock outcropping 
with a resemblance to a skull, a heap of rubble, or perhaps the 
crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is 
dark and twisted, its branches reaching out to snare travelers' cloaks, 
and its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by.</p><p>Shadow

 to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations where the veil between

lingers, such as battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only

 Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, 
providing the raw elemental substance from which all worlds were made. 
The four Elemental Planes-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around
 the Material Plane, suspended within a churning realm known as the 
Elemental Chaos. These planes are all connected, and the border regions 
between them are sometimes described as distinct planes in their own 
right.</p><p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the 
Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), 
the four Elemental Planes resemble places in the Material Plane. The 
four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming 
land, sea, and sky. But the dominant element exerts a strong influence 
on the environment, reflecting its fundamental qualities.</p><p>The 
inhabitants of this inner ring include aarakocra, azers, dragon turtles,
 gargoyles, genies, mephits, salamanders, and xorn. Some originated on 
the Material Plane, and all can travel to the Material Plane (if they 
have access to the magic required) and survive there.</p><p>As they 
extend farther from the Material Plane, the Elemental Planes become 
increasingly alien and hostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the 
elements exist in their purest form: great expanses of solid earth, 
blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any foreign 
substance is extremely rare; little air can be found in the outermost 
reaches of the Plane of Earth, and earth is all but impossible to find 
in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less
 hospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than the border regions
 are. Such regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of 
Fire, for example, a speaker usually means the border region.</p><p>The 
outermost regions are largely the domains of elemental spirits barely 
recognizable as creatures. The creatures usually called elementals dwell
 here, including the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial beings of 
pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits that spellcasters can bind 
into galeb duhrs, golems, invisible stalkers, magmin, and water weirds. 
These elemental creatures don't need food or other sustenance on their 
home planes, because they are sustained by the elemental energies that 
saturate those planes.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="233" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Elemental Chaos</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p52</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>At
 the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure elements 
dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies
 and colliding substance called the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be 
found here as well, but they usually don't stay long, preferring the 
comfort of their native planes. Reports indicate the existence of weird 
hybrid elementals native to the Elemental Chaos, but such creatures are 
seldom seen on other planes.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="234" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Plane of Air</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p53</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 essential nature of air is movement, animation, and inspiration. Air is
 the breath of life, the winds of change, the fresh breeze that clears 
away the fog of ignorance and the stuffiness of old ideas.</p><p>The 
Plane of Air is an open expanse with constant winds of varying strength.
 Here and there, chunks of earth drift in the openness-the remnants of 
failed invasions by denizens of the Plane of Earth. These earth motes 
serve as homes for the creatures of elemental air, and many motes are 
covered with lush vegetation. Other creatures live on cloud banks 
infused with enough magic to become solid surfaces, strong enough to 
support towns and castles.</p><p>Drifting cloud banks can obscure 
visibility in any direction in the plane. Storms are frequent, mostly on
 par with a strong thunderstorm but occasionally more like fierce 
tornadoes or mighty hurricanes. The air is mild, except near the Plane 
of Water (where it is biting cold) and the Plane of Fire (where it is 
searing hot). Rain and snow fall only in the part of the plane nearest 
to the Plane of Water.</p><p>Most of the Plane of Air is a complex web of air streams, currents, and winds called the <b>Labyrinth Winds</b>.
 These range from stiff breezes to howling gales that can rip a creature
 apart. Even the most skilled flying creatures must navigate these 
currents carefully, flying with the winds, not against them.</p><p>Here 
and there among the Labyrinth Winds are hidden realms reachable only by 
following a particular sequence of flowing winds, and thus largely 
protected against attackers. One such realm is fabled <b>Aaqa</b>, a 
shining domain of silver spires and verdant gardens atop a fertile earth
 mote. The Wind Dukes of Aaqa are dedicated to law and good, and they 
maintain a vigilant watch against the depredations of elemental evil and
 the encroachment of the Elemental Chaos. They are served by aarakocra 
and a little-known race called the vaati.</p><p>The region of the Plane of Air nearest the Great Conflagration is called the <b>Sirocco Straits</b>.
 Hot, dry winds scour the earth motes in this area to dry and barren 
chunks of rock. Gargoyles and their allies from the Plane of Earth 
gather here to launch raids into the realm of Aaqa.</p><p>Between the Sea of Fire (on the Plane of Fire) and the Sirocco Straits is a towering firestorm called the <b>Great Conflagration</b>,
 sometimes called the Plane of Ash. Howling winds from the Plane of Air 
mix with the cinder storms and lava of the Plane of Fire to create an 
endless storm front-a wall of flames, smoke, and ash.</p><p>The thick 
ash obscures sight beyond a few dozen feet, and the battering winds make
 travel difficult. Here and there, ash clusters into floating realms 
where outlaws and fugitives take shelter.</p><p>At the other end of the 
plane, near the Frostfell (the plane of ice that borders the Plane of 
Water), is a region of frigid winds called the <b>Mistral Reach</b>. 
These gales drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it, toward
 the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach are covered with snow 
and ice.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="235" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Plane of Earth</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p54</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Earth
 symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and tradition. The 
plane's position opposite the Plane of Air in the ring of the Elemental 
Planes reflects its opposition to almost everything air represents.</p><p>The
 Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising higher than any mountain 
range in the Material Plane. It has no sun of its own, and no air 
surrounds the peaks of its highest mountains. Most visitors to the plane
 arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the mountains.</p><p>The
 largest cavern beneath the mountains, called the Great Dismal Delve or 
the Sevenfold Mazework, is home to the capital city of the dao, the <b>City of Jewels</b>.
 The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams of slaves 
across the plane in search of new veins of ore and gemstones to exploit.
 Thanks to their efforts, every building and significant object in the 
city is made from precious stones and metals, including the slender 
gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city is protected by
 a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao population if a visitor 
steals even a single stone. Theft is punishable by death, with 
punishment extending to the thief's relatives.</p><p>The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on the Plane of Fire) are called the <b>Furnaces</b>.
 Lava seeps through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The dao 
have great forges and smelting furnaces here to process their ores and 
shape their precious metals.</p><p>The border region between the planes 
of Water and Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees and 
thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and slime. Here and there
 within the <b>Swamp of Oblivion</b> (also called the Plane of Ooze), 
stagnant lakes and pools play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous 
swarms of mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden 
structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on platforms between
 trees, but a few stand on stilts driven deep into the muck. No solid 
earth underlies the mud of the swamp, so houses built on poles 
eventually sink down into it.</p><p>It is said that any object cast into
 the Swamp of Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century. Now 
and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into this place, 
removing it from the multiverse for a time. The promise of powerful 
magic lures adventurers to brave the monstrous insects and hags of the 
swamp in search of these treasures.</p><p>The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of Oblivion is called the <b>Mud Hills</b>.
 Landslides constantly wear away the slopes of the hills, sending 
cascades of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The Plane of 
Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land, pushing new hills up as 
the old ones erode to nothing.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="236" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Plane of Fire</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p55</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Fire

 above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 24-hour cycle. It 
ranges from white hot at noon to deep red at midnight, so the darkest 
hours of the plane display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is 
nearly blinding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) takes 
place during the darker hours.</p><p>The weather on the plane is marked 
by fierce winds and thick ash. Although the air is breathable, creatures
 not native to the plane must cover their mouths and eyes to avoid 
stinging cinders. The efreet use magic to keep the cinder storms away 
from the City of Brass, but elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always 
at least blustery and rises to hurricane force during the worst storms.</p><p>The
 heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to a hot desert on the Material
 Plane, and poses a similar threat to travelers (see "Extreme Heat" in 
chapter 5, "Adventure Environments"). The deeper one goes into the 
plane, the rarer water becomes. Beyond a point, the plane holds no 
sources of water, so travelers must carry their own supplies or produce 
water by magic.</p><p>The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast <b>Cinder Wastes</b>,
 a great expanse of black cinders and embers crossed by rivers of lava. 
Roving bands of salamanders battle each other, raid azer outposts, and 
avoid the efreet. Ancient ruins dot the desert-remnants of forgotten 
civilizations.</p><p>A great range of volcanic mountains called the <b>Fountains of Creation</b>
 is home to azers. These rocky peaks curl from the edge of the Plane of 
Earth around the Cinder Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane. At 
the edge of the plane, the mountains are also called the Plane of Magma.
 Fire giants and red dragons make their homes here, as well as creatures
 from the neighboring planes.</p><p>Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane of Air and pools into a great lava sea, called the <b>Sea of Fire</b>,
 sailed by efreet and azers in great brass ships. Islands of obsidian 
and basalt jut up from the sea, dotted with ancient ruins and the lairs 
of powerful red dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands the <b>City of Brass</b>.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="237" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The City of Brass</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p55</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Perhaps
 the best-known location in the Inner Planes is the City of Brass, on 
the shores of the Sea of Fire. This is the fabled city of the efreet, 
and its ornate spires and metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel 
nature.</p><p>True to the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in the
 city seems alive with dancing flames, reflecting the vibrant energy of 
the place.</p><p>Adventurers frequently come here on quests for 
legendary magic. If it's possible to buy magic items at all, the City of
 Brass is the most likely place to find any item for sale, though the 
price might well be more than gold. The efreet are fond of trading in 
favors, especially when they have the upper hand in negotiations. 
Perhaps a magical disease or poison can be cured only with something 
that must be purchased in the bazaars of the city.</p><p>The heart of 
the city is the towering Charcoal Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of
 the efreet reigns supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of 
slaves, guardians, and sycophants.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="238" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Plane of Water</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p56</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind or the leaping 
flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the rhythm of the tide, the 
nectar of life, the bitter tears of mourning, and the balm of sympathy 
and healing. Given time, it can erode all in its path.</p><p>A warm sun 
arcs across the sky of the Plane of Water, seeming to rise and set from 
within the water at the visible edge of the horizon. Several times a 
day, however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge of rain, often 
accompanied by spectacular shows of lightning, before clearing up again.
 At night, a glittering array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky.</p><p>The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the <b>Sea of Worlds</b>,
 dotted here and there with atolls and islands that rise up from 
enormous coral reefs that seem to stretch forever into the depths. The 
storms that move across the sea sometimes create temporary portals to 
the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane of Water. Surviving 
vessels from countless worlds and navies ply these waters with little 
hope of ever returning home.</p><p>The weather on the plane is a lesson 
in extremes. If the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare 
occasions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a rogue wave sweeping 
across the plane, swamping entire islands and driving ships down to the 
reefs.</p><p>Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of Worlds, called the <b>Sea of Light</b>
 because of the sunlight filtering down into the water. Aquatic 
humanoids craft castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids 
are the distant stewards of this region, content to allow the lesser 
folk to compete for territory. The nominal emperor of the marids dwells 
in the <b>Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls</b>, an opulent palace made of coral and studded with pearls.</p><p>The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight reaches, are called the <b>Darkened Depths</b>.
 Horrid creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing 
pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed to the surface or the 
Sea of Light. Krakens and other mighty leviathans claim this realm.</p><p>Any
 land that rises above the surface of the sea is hotly contested by the 
few air-breathers that live on the plane. Fleets of rafts and ships 
lashed together serve as solid ground where nothing else is available. 
Most natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea and thus 
ignore these habitations.</p><p>One of the few actual islands on the plane is the <b>Isle of Dread</b>.
 The island is connected to the Material Plane by means of a regular 
storm that sweeps over the island. Travelers who know the strange tides 
and currents of the plane can travel between worlds freely, but the 
storms also wreck ships from the Material Plane on the island's shore.</p><p>The region of the Plane of Water nearest the Swamp of Oblivion (on the Plane of Earth) is called the <b>Silt Flats</b>. The water is thick with soil and sludge, and turns into muddy ground before giving way to the great swamp between the planes.</p><p>At the other extreme of the plane is the <b>Sea of Ice</b>,
 bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with icebergs and 
sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving creatures that inhabit the 
Frostfell. Drifting icebergs can carry these creatures farther into the 
Plane of Water to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas.</p><p>The <b>Frostfell</b>,
 also called the Plane of Ice, forms the border between the planes of 
Air and Water and is a seemingly endless glacier swept by constant, 
raging blizzards. Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of Ice, home to
 yetis, remorhazes, white dragons, and other creatures of cold. The 
inhabitants of the plane engage in a never-ending battle to prove their 
strength and ensure their survival.</p><p>Its dangerous monsters and 
bitter cold make the Frostfell a dangerous place to travel. Most planar 
voyagers keep to the air, braving the powerful winds and driving snow to
 avoid setting foot on the great glacier.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="239" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Outer Planes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p57</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p class="rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last">“<i>Streamers

 the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the 
multiverse, the Outer Planes provide the direction, thought, and purpose
 for its construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes
 as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer 
Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p><p>When discussing 
anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly 
metaphorical. Their actual homes aren't literally places at all, but 
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and 
spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible 
part of the Outer Planes as a border region, while extensive spiritual 
regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p><p>Even in 
perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of 
the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the 
Material Plane. But the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful 
forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake them completely, 
effectively erasing and rebuilding existence to better fulfill their 
divine needs.</p><p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the 
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can seem quite 
small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. 
Adventurers could take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first 
layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire 
it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a
 single layer.</p><p>The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen 
planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality, 
which is represented by the Outlands, described in the section on "Other
 Planes") and the shades of distinction between them.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="240">The Outer Planes</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Outer Plane</th><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Alignment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-6">Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of</td><td class="col-6">LG</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Bytopia, the Twin Paradises of</td><td class="col-6">NG, LG</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Elysium, the Blessed Fields of</td><td class="col-6">NG</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">The Beastlands, the Wilderness of</td><td class="col-6">NG, CG</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Arborea, the Olympian Glades of</td><td class="col-6">CG</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Ysgard, the Heroic Domains of</td><td class="col-6">CN, CG</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Limbo, the Ever-Changing Chaos of</td><td class="col-6">CN</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Pandemonium, the Windswept Depths of</td><td class="col-6">CN, CE</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">The Abyss, the Infinite Layers of</td><td class="col-6">CE</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Carceri, the Tarterian Depths of</td><td class="col-6">NE, CE</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Hades, the Gray Waste of</td><td class="col-6">NE</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Gehenna, the Bleak Eternity of</td><td class="col-6">NE, LE</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">The Nine Hells of Baator</td><td class="col-6">LE</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield of</td><td class="col-6">LN, LE</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana of</td><td class="col-6">LN</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Arcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms of</td><td class="col-6">LN, LG</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The planes with an element of good in their nature are called the <b>Upper Planes</b>, while those with an element of evil are the <b>Lower Planes</b>.
 A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment 
doesn't match the plane's alignment experiences a sense of dissonance 
there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it feels in 
tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more 
than a little uncomfortable.</p><p>The Upper Planes are the home of 
celestial creatures, including angels, couatls, and pegasi. The Lower 
Planes are the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, and their ilk.
 The planes in between host their own unique denizens: the construct 
race of modrons inhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called slaadi 
thrive in Limbo.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="241" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Layers of the Outer Planes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p58</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Most
 of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct environments or 
realms. These realms are often imagined and depicted as a stack of 
related parts of the same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. 
For example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer cake, the 
Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has a seemingly endless number
 of layers.</p><p>Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a
 multilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as the top or 
bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the arrival point for most 
visitors, the first layer functions like a city gate for that plane.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="242" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Traveling the Outer Planes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p58</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Traveling

 a color pool leading to the desired destination. Characters can also 
use plane shift to reach a different plane more directly. Most often, 
though, characters use portals-either a portal that links the two planes
 directly or a portal leading to Sigil, City of Doors, which holds 
portals to all the planes.</p><p>Two planar features connect multiple 
Outer Planes together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. Other 
planar crossings might exist in your campaign, such as a World Tree 
whose roots touch the Lower Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper
 Planes, or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another in 
your cosmology.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="243" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The River Styx</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p58</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>This

snake onto lower layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the 
Styx winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing passage from 
one layer of that plane to the next.</p><p>Sinister ferries float on the
 waters of the Styx, crewed by pilots skilled in negotiating the 
unpredictable currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these 
pilots are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. Some of them
 are fiends, while others are the souls of dead creatures from the

 Infinite Staircase is an extra dimensional spiral staircase that 
connects the planes. An entrance to the Infinite Staircase usually 
appears as a nondescript door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing 
with an equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The Infinite 
Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and descends, going from 
simple stairs of wood or stone to a chaotic jumble of stairs hanging in 
radiant space, where no two steps share the same gravitational 
orientation. It is said that one can find one's heart's desire on the 
Infinite Staircase through diligent searching of each landing.</p><p>Doors
 to the Infinite Staircase are often tucked away in dusty, 
half-forgotten places that no one frequents or pays any attention to. On
 any given plane, there can be multiple doors to the Infinite Staircase,
 though entrances aren't common knowledge and are occasionally guarded 
by devas, sphinxes, yugoloths, and other powerful monsters.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="245" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Optional Rules</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p59</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Each
 of the Outer Planes has peculiar characteristics that make traveling

in various ways, such as causing them to take on personality traits or

 to more closely match the native inhabitants of the plane. Each plane's
 description includes one or more optional rules that you can use to

ones on the Upper Planes-if they spend too much time on the plane. You 
can reflect this dissonance with this optional rule. At the end of a 
long rest spent on an incompatible plane, a visitor must make a DC 10

justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, where angels 
and champions of good guard against incursions of evil. It is one of the
 few places on the planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its 
inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as possible. Countless 
creatures aim to reach the highest and most sublime peak of the

creatures are literally blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the

diamond that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and on and on in an 
endless, unpredictable process of change. Fragments of more ordinary 
landscapes-bits of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling 
streams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is a nightmarish 
riot.</p><p>Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane float 
in place. A creature can move up to its walking speed in any direction 
by merely thinking of the desired direction of travel.</p><p>Limbo 
conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting it. Very disciplined 
and powerful minds can create whole islands of their own invention 
within the plane, sometimes maintaining those places for years. A 
simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might have less than a 
minute before the pocket of water surrounding it freezes, vanishes, or 
turns to glass. The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, creating 
nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire monasteries with their

 an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to 
mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of 
it. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small,
 DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a 
successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for 
every point by which it beat the DC.</p><p>A creature can also use an 
action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that 
isn't being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the 
DC is based on the object's size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20
 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature 
changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as
 turning a boulder into a ball of fire.</p><p>Finally, a creature can 
use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical 
area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the 
sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10
 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5. On a successful check, 
the creature prevents the area from being altered by the plane for 24 
hours, or until the creature uses this ability again.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="262" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Pandemonium</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p62</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Pandemonium

 such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point for visitors to 
the plane. Avernus is a rocky wasteland with rivers of blood and clouds 
of biting flies. Fiery comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky

with weapons and bones, showing where the legions of the Nine Hells met 
enemies on their native soil and prevailed.</p><p>The archduchess Zariel
 rules Avernus, supplanting her rival, Bel, who has fallen out of 
Asmodeus's favor and is forced to serve as Zariel's advisor. Tiamat, the
 Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer, ruling her own 
domain but confined to the Nine Hells by Asmodeus in accordance with 
some ancient contract (the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and 
the Lords of the Nine).</p><p>Zariel's seat of power is a soaring basalt
 citadel festooned with the partially incinerated corpses of guests who 
failed to earn the archduchess's favor. Zariel appears as an angel whose

with a furious white light that can cause creatures looking upon her to

perched atop jagged pinnacles.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The
 second layer takes its name from its current lord, Dispater. A 
manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is devilishly handsome, bearing 
only small horns, a tail, and a cloven left hoof to distinguish him from
 a human. His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City of 
Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the Nine Hells. Planar 
travelers come here to conspire with devils and to close deals with 
night hags, rakshasas, incubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater 
collects a piece of every deal through special provisions that are added
 to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells.</p><p>Dispater is 
one of Asmodeus's most loyal and resourceful vassals, and few beings in 
the multiverse can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils with
 striking deals with mortals in exchange for their souls, and his

careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately carved stone rise up 
from the bog, including the great city of Minauros for which the layer 
is named.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The slimy walls 
of the city rise hundreds of feet into the air, protecting the flooded

greed is legendary, and he is one of the few archdevils who will trade

tandem: Archduke Belial and Archduchess Fierna, Belial's daughter. 
Belial is a handsome, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, even 
as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His daughter is a

ruler, the serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed by Asmodeus to
 allow the imprisoned Levistus to regain his rule. Geryon's fall from

struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while her predecessor, 
Moloch, still lingers somewhere on the sixth layer as an imp, plotting 
to regain Asmodeus's favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like 
the sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the layer break off

The inhabitants of Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves
 carved into the mountainside.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Malbolge's
 current archduchess is Asmodeus's daughter, Glasya. She resembles a 
succubus with her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She 
inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from her father. The 
citadel that serves as her domicile on the slopes of Malbolge is 
supported by cracked pillars and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on 
the verge of collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with

 Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend
 with the lower body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was inflicted
 on him by Asmodeus as punishment for wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a 
miserable and degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to usurp 
Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries a curse that causes 
any deal made with him to lead to calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows 
Baalzebul favor for reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some

this fallen adversary.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="290" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cania.</span></span> <p>Cania,

 dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, where he plots to seize the 
Throne of Baator and conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy

counsel when it is offered.</p><p>Mephistopheles knows he can't depose 
Asmodeus until his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so both 
wait to see what circumstances might turn them against each other. 
Mephistopheles is also a godfather of sorts to Glasya, further 
complicating the relationship.</p><p>Mephistopheles is a tall, striking 
devil with impressive horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, as 
do other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to any creatures not 
worthy of his personal attention. His instincts are as razor sharp as

depth, out of which rises the great citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to 
Asmodeus and his infernal court.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Malsheem
 resembles a gigantic hollowed-out stalagmite. The citadel is also a 
prison for souls that Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. 
Convincing him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep

kingdoms in the past for such favors.</p><p>Asmodeus most often appears

forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. He can also assume other
 forms and is seldom seen without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. 
Asmodeus is the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The 
ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he wills it so, or if

 of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The most widely known 
worlds are the ones that have been published as official campaign 
settings for the D&amp;D game over the years. If your campaign takes 
place on one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your 
campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly from what's in 
print.</p><p>On <b>Toril</b> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten 
Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand amid the remains of
 ancient empires and realms long forgotten. The world is vast, its 
dungeons rich with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerun, 
Toril includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur, and Maztica.</p><p>On <b>Oerth</b>
 (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Greyhawk setting), heroes such as 
Bigby and Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The hub of the 
region called the Flanaess is the Free City of Greyhawk, a city of 
scoundrels and archmagi, rife with adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, 
rules a nightmarish realm in the north, threatening all civilization.</p><p>On <b>Krynn</b>
 (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance setting), the return of the 
gods is overshadowed by the rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and 
her dragons and dragon armies, which plunge the continent of Ansalon 
into war.</p><p>On <b>Athas</b> (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark
 Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a human life. The 
gods have abandoned this desert world, where powerful sorcerer-kings 
rule as tyrants, and metal is a scarce and precious commodity.</p><p>On <b>Eberron</b>
 (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron setting), a terrible war has 
ended, giving rise to a cold war fueled by political intrigue. On the 
continent of Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked houses rival 
kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles make travel to the far corners
 of the world possible.</p><p>On <b>Aebrynis</b> (the heroic-fantasy 
world of the Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines 
carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, guildmasters, and
 great wizards balance the demands of rulership against the threat of 
horrible abominations born from the blood of an evil god.</p><p>On <b>Mystara</b>
 (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the earliest editions of the 
D&amp;D game), diverse cultures, savage monsters, and warring empires 
collide. The world is further shaped by the meddling of the 
Immortals-former adventurers raised to nearly divine status.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="306" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Creating
 adventures is one of the greatest rewards of being a Dungeon Master. 
It's a way to express yourself, designing fantastic locations and 
encounters with monsters, traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you design
 an adventure, you call the shots. You do things exactly the way you 
want to.</p><p>Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure 
shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an issue of a comic, or
 an episode of a TV show. Comic series and serialized TV dramas are 
particularly good comparisons, because of the way individual adventures 
are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger narrative. If
 an adventure is a single issue or episode, a campaign is the series as a
 whole.</p><p>Whether you're creating your own adventures or using 
published adventures, you'll find advice in this chapter to help you 
create a fun and memorable experience for your players.</p><p>Creating 
an adventure involves blending scenes of exploration, social 
interaction, and combat into a unified whole that meets the needs of 
your players and your campaign. But it's more than that. The basic 
elements of good storytelling should guide you throughout this process, 
so your players experience the adventure as a story and not a disjointed
 series of encounters.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="307" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Elements of a Great Adventure</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The best adventures have several things in common.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="308" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">A Credible Threat</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>An
 adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes' attention. The threat 
might be a single villain or monster, a villain with lackeys, an 
assortment of monsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their nature, 
the antagonists should have goals that the heroes can uncover and 
thwart.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="309" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Familiar Tropes with Clever Twists</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>It
 might seem stereotypical to build an adventure around dragons, orcs, 
and insane wizards in towers, but these are staples of fantasy 
storytelling. It might also seem trite to begin an adventure in a 
tavern, but that's an idea that remains true to D&amp;D. Familiar story 
elements are fine, as long as you and the players occasionally put a 
spin on them. For example, the mysterious figure who presents 
adventurers with a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in 
disguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a projected illusion 
created by a band of greedy gnome thieves to guard their loot.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="310" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">A Clear Focus on the Present</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>An
 adventure is about the here and now. A little bit of history might be 
needed to set the story in motion, and the adventurers might discover 
interesting lore of the past in the course of the adventure. In general,
 let the world's history be evident in the present situation. Instead of
 dealing with what happened in the past, an adventure should focus on 
describing the present situation, what the bad guys are up to, and how 
the adventurers become involved in the story.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="311" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Heroes Who Matter</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>An
 adventure should allow the adventurers' actions and decisions to 
matter. Though it might resemble a novel or a TV episode, an adventure 
needs to allow for more than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel as
 if they've been railroaded-set onto a course that has only one 
destination, no matter how hard they try to change it. For example, if a
 major villain shows up before the end of the adventure, the adventure 
should allow for the possibility that the heroes might defeat that 
villain.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="312" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Something for All Player Types</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As
 outlined in the book's introduction, players come to the gaming table 
with different expectations. An adventure needs to account for the 
different players and characters in your group, drawing them into the 
story as effectively as possible.</p><p>As a starting point, think about
 your adventure in terms of the three basic types of activity in the 
game: exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your adventure 
includes a balance of all three, it's likely to appeal to all types of 
players.</p><p>An adventure you create for your home campaign doesn't 
have to appeal to every abstract player type—only to the players sitting
 down at your own table. If you don't have any players who like fighting
 above all else, then don't feel you have to provide a maximum amount of
 combat to keep the adventure moving.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="313" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Surprises</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p71</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Look
 for opportunities to surprise and delight your players. For example, 
the exploration of a ruined castle on a hill might lead to the discovery
 of a dragon's tomb hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness 
might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only on nights of 
the full moon. Players remember such locations.</p><p>Too many surprises
 can be off-putting to players, but adding the occasional twist gets 
players to adjust their tactics and think creatively. For example, you 
could spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers with kegs of 
oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a villain's estate might be 
complicated by the unexpected arrival of a special guest.</p><p>When 
preparing for possible combat encounters, think about odd pairings of 
monsters, such as a hobgoblin warlord and his pet manticore, or 
will-o'-wisps in league with a young black dragon. Have surprise 
reinforcements show up, or give the monsters unusual tactics. Throw in 
the occasional red herring, deception, and plot twist to keep players on
 their toes, but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, 
straightforward encounter with an orc guard is just as fun for your 
players.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="314" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Useful Maps</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed maps. Wilderness areas 
sprinkled with interesting landmarks and other features are better than 
vast expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have branching 
corridors and similar decision points give players the opportunity to 
choose which direction their characters should go. Presenting the 
characters with options allows the players to make choices that keep the
 adventure unpredictable.</p><p>If drawing maps isn't your strong suit, 
the Internet is a great place to look for adventure maps that have been 
made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of real-world 
buildings and images that can inspire your mapmaking. You can also use 
software to help put your maps together.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="315" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Published Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Published
 adventures are available for purchase if you have neither the time nor 
the inclination to write an adventure of your own, or if you want a 
change of pace.</p><p>A published adventure includes a pregenerated 
scenario with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need to run 
it. An example of a published adventure appears in the D&amp;D Starter 
Set.</p><p>You can make adjustments to a published adventure so that it 
better suits your campaign and appeals to your players. For example, you
 can replace the villain of an adventure with one the players have 
already encountered in your campaign, or add something to the background
 of the adventure so that it involves your players' characters in ways 
that the adventure's designer never could have imagined.</p><p>A 
published adventure can't account for every action the characters might 
take. The nice thing about published adventures is that they allow you 
to focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot developments in
 your campaign that the adventure can't address.</p><p>Published 
adventures also provide inspiration. You might not use an adventure as 
written, but it might spur ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and
 repurpose that part for your needs. For example, you might use a map of
 a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your choice, or you might 
use a chase sequence as a model for a pursuit scene in your campaign.</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="316" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adventure Structure</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="317" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Beginning</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>An
 adventure starts with a hook to get the players interested. A good 
adventure hook piques the interest of the players and provides a 
compelling reason for their characters to become involved in the 
adventure. Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they're not 
meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an assassin makes an 
attempt on their lives, or a dragon shows up at the city gates. 
Adventure hooks such as these can instantly draw players into your 
story.</p><p>The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting and 
focused. You want the players to go home looking forward to the next 
session, so give them a clear sense of where the story is headed, as 
well as something to look forward to.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="318" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Middle</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the story unfolds. With 
each new challenge, the adventurers make important choices that have a 
clear effect on the conclusion of the adventure.</p><p>Over the course 
of the adventure, the characters might discover secrets that reveal new 
goals or change their original goal. Their understanding of what's going
 on around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure were a trick to 
lure them into a death trap. Perhaps the so-called spy in the queen's 
court is actually a scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize 
even more power.</p><p>At the same time the adventurers are working to 
thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying to carry out 
their nefarious plans. Such enemies might also work to hide their deeds,
 mislead potential adversaries, or confront problems directly, perhaps 
by trying to kill meddlers.</p><p>Remember that the characters are the 
heroes of the story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching as 
events unfold around them that they can't influence.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="319" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ending</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 ending encompasses the climax-the scene or encounter in which the 
tension building throughout the adventure reaches its peak. A strong 
climax should have the players on edge, with the fate of the characters 
and much more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which hinges on the 
characters' actions and decisions, should never be a forgone conclusion.</p><p>An
 ending needn't tie everything up in a neat bow. Story threads can be 
left hanging, waiting to be resolved in a later adventure. A little bit 
of unfinished business is an easy way to transition from one adventure 
to the next.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="320" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adventure Types</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>An adventure can be location-based or event-based, as discussed in the sections that follow.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="321" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Location Based Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Adventures

 you've created the location and the overall story of the adventure, 
it's time to plan out the encounters that make up that adventure. In a 
location-based adventure, most encounters are keyed to specific 
locations on a map. For each room or wilderness area on the adventure 
map, your key describes what's in that area: its physical features, as 
well as any encounter that plays out there. The adventure key turns a 
simple sketch of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters designed 
to entertain and intrigue your players.</p><p>See "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for guidance on crafting individual encounters.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="336" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Event Based Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p75</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the characters and 
villains do and what happens as a result. The question of where those 
things happen is of secondary importance.</p><p>Building an event-based 
adventure is more work than building a location-based one, but the 
process can be simplified by following a number of straightforward 
steps. Several steps include tables from which you can choose adventure 
elements or roll randomly for inspiration. As with location-based 
adventures, you don't necessarily have to follow these steps in order.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="337" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">1.

 care into creating your villain will pay off later, since the villain 
plays such a pivotal role in advancing the story. Use the Adventure 
Villains table in the previous section to get started, and use the 
information in chapter 4 to help flesh out the villain.</p><p>For 
example, your villain might be an undead creature seeking to avenge a 
past imprisonment or injury. An interesting aspect of an undead villain 
is that this past injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring 
revenge against the descendants of those that harmed it. Imagine a 
vampire imprisoned by the members of a religious order of knights, and 
who now seeks revenge against the current members of that order.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="338" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">2.

 you have a villain, it's time to determine what steps the villain takes
 to achieve its goals. Create a timeline showing what the villain does 
and when, assuming no interference from the adventurers.</p><p>Building 
on the previous example, you might decide that your vampire villain 
murders several knights. By slipping past locked doors in gaseous form, 
the vampire is able to make the deaths appear natural at first, but it 
soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind the murders.</p><p>If
 you need additional inspiration, consider a few different options for 
how the villain's actions unfold over the course of the adventure.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="339">Event-Based Villain Actions</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

repetitive in nature, rather than escalating to greater heights of

example of this type of villain, your villain could be a serial arsonist
 favoring a certain type of building, a magical sickness that affects

(See chapter 4 for more information on creating NPCs.)</p><p>The 
elements of the adventure you've determined so far should provide a 
clear idea of what supporting characters you need to create, as well as 
how much detail you need to generate for each one. NPCs unlikely to

example, just as characters heavily involved in negotiation could have 
ideals, bonds, and flaws. If it's helpful, roll on the Adventure Allies

 from those actions, think about how the adventurers are likely to 
react. If they can prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect

 compensate?</p><p>One way to track a villain's reactions is by using a 
flowchart. This might grow out of the timeline that describes the 
villain's plans, outlining how the villain gets back on track after the 
adventurers thwart its plans. Or the flowchart could be separate from 
the timeline, showing the various actions the adventurers might take and

your adventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple plea for help.
 The Adventure Climax table in that same section includes adventure 
endings that work just as well for event-based adventures.</p><p>For 
example, the Adventure Introduction table helps you decide that an ally 
the adventurers care about needs their help. Perhaps the NPC is a knight
 who believes that a vampire is trying to kill him, or a friend or 
relative hoping to find the knight's murderer. This NPC brings the 
vampire's crimes to the characters' attention.</p><p>Looking over the 
Adventure Climax table, you might decide to have the adventurers bait 
the vampire with a chest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added 
twist, you decide that the vampire's true goal is to retrieve a necklace
 among the jewels. The necklace is set with nine gems, and with these 
gems the vampire can open a gate to the Nine Hells. Should the vampire 
succeed, the adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal with, 
as a powerful devil steps through the gate and honors some ancient pact 
it made with the vampire.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="352" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">8.

 you've created the overall story of the adventure, it's time to plan 
out the encounters on which the events of that adventure will hang. In 
an event-based adventure, encounters occur when the villain's agenda 
intersects the path of the characters. You can't always anticipate 
exactly when or where that will happen, but you can create a list of 
possible encounters that the adventurers might experience. This can take
 the form of general descriptions of the villain's forces, details of 
its lieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to the key 
locations of the adventure.</p><p>See "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for guidance on crafting individual encounters.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="353" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mysteries</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p77</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 mystery is a form of event-based adventure that usually focuses on the 
adventurers' efforts to solve a crime, usually a robbery or murder. 
Unlike the writer of a mystery novel, a Dungeon Master can't always 
predict what the characters will do in a mystery adventure.</p><p>A 
villain whose actions are "crime spree," "one and done," or "serial 
crimes" might inspire you to craft a mystery adventure around that 
villain's crimes. Similarly, if the adventurers' goals include 
determining the villain's identity, that might be part of a mystery.</p><p>To
 build a mystery adventure, follow the steps for creating any 
event-based adventure. Then consider three additional elements for the 
adventure: the victim, the suspects, and the clues.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="354" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Victim</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p77</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Think
 about the victim's relationship to the villain. Though you can create a
 strong scenario with no such relationship, part of what makes a mystery
 exciting is the discovery of the twisted connections between NPCs and 
how those connections led to the crime. A random killing might be just 
as mysterious, but it lacks that emotional connection.</p><p>Also look 
for a connection between the victim and one or more of the adventurers. 
One surefire way to draw adventurers into a mystery-including making 
them suspects-is to make the victim someone with whom the characters are
 acquainted.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="355" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Suspects</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p77</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Your
 cast of characters should include an assortment of other NPCs who 
didn't commit the crime, but who had the motive, the means, or the 
opportunity to do so. Suspects might be obvious or could come to light 
during the investigation. One technique often used in detective fiction 
is to create a closed circle of suspects-a finite number of individuals 
whose circumstances make them the only possible suspects.</p><p>One tip 
for keeping the players and the adventurers guessing as to the identity 
of the villain is to ensure that more than one suspect has a secret. 
When questioned by the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or 
attempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A secret business 
deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an uncontrolled vice are flaws 
that make suspects more interesting than NPCs with nothing to hide.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="356" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Clues</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p78</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Clues
 point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are verbal, including 
the statements of the suspects and witnesses that help the adventurers 
develop a picture of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an
 unfinished message written in the victim's blood, a piece of jewelry 
left behind by the villain, or a weapon found hidden in a suspect's 
room.</p><p>A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically by 
shedding light on the suspect's motive, means, or opportunity. Some 
clues connect the wrong suspect to the crime, leading the adventurers in
 the wrong direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing in
 a different direction, or come across evidence that absolves the 
suspect.</p><p>It's better to populate your adventure with too many 
clues than too few. If the adventurers solve the mystery too quickly, 
you might feel some disappointment but the players will feel a sense of 
accomplishment. If the mystery is too hard, though, the players will 
become frustrated. Since you have to account for the possibility that 
the adventurers will overlook some clues, use redundant clues to ensure 
that the players have the knowledge needed to catch the villain.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="357" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Intrigue</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p78</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Intrigue
 adventures are event-based adventures that revolve around power 
struggles. Intrigues are common in the courts of the nobility, but power
 struggles can play out just as easily in merchants' guilds, crime 
syndicates, and temple hierarchies.</p><p>Rather than dark events and 
villainous plots, an intrigue adventure typically revolves around the 
exchange of favors, the rise and fall of individuals in power and 
influence, and the honeyed words of diplomacy. A prince's efforts to be 
named heir to the throne, a courtier's ambition to sit at the queen's 
right hand, and a merchant's desire to open a trade route through enemy 
lands are the stuff of intrigue.</p><p>Like all adventures, an intrigue 
adventure works only if the players and their characters are invested in
 the outcome. If no one cares who the king's chamberlain is or who has 
logging rights in the elven woods, throwing the characters into an 
adventure centered on those issues will fall flat. However, if having 
the ear of the king's chamberlain means the characters can use royal 
soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the borderlands, 
players will be invested in the scenario.</p><p>Adventurers usually 
become embroiled in intrigue when they need a favor from a powerful 
creature and have to perform a favor in exchange, or when the plots of 
powerful NPCs get in the way of the characters achieving their goals. 
Some of the event-based goals discussed earlier in this section lend 
themselves to intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers must 
uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or secure aid from a 
ruler or council, you might be looking at an intrigue adventure.</p><p>The
 process of creating an intrigue adventure is similar to creating any 
other event-based adventure, with two main differences: how villains are
 handled and how the characters can gain influence.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="358" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Villains</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p78</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Some

 intrigue adventures revolve around the exchange of favors in the 
absence of a villain. For this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of 
the event-based adventure creation process (the villain and the 
villain's actions) and move straight to the adventurers' goals in step 
3. Figure out why the adventurers become involved in the intrigue, then 
spend the bulk of your time creating the NPCs they interact with.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="360" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Many Villains.</span></span> <p>Some
 intrigue adventures feature a whole cast of villains, each with its own
 goals, motivations, and methods. The adventurers might be drawn into 
the struggle of a court full of nobles vying for the throne in the wake 
of the king's sudden death, or could find themselves negotiating the end
 to a deadly turf war among thieves' guilds. In this scenario, you'll 
spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2, developing each of the major NPCs 
as a distinct villain with an agenda. In step 5, you'll need to develop 
each villain's reactions to the potential setbacks they face during the 
adventure.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>However, you 
don't need to put equal effort into detailing the reactions of every 
villain, since many will likely echo each other or cancel each other 
out. Whenever the adventurers foil one villain's plans, it might let 
another villain's schemes move forward, advancing the adventure whether 
the foiled villain reacts or not.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="361" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Influence</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p78</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Depending
 on the scenario, you might want to track the party's influence with 
different NPCs or factions, or even track influence separately for each 
character.</p><p>One way to handle influence is to treat it like 
inspiration. A character gains influence in a certain situation only if 
you grant it, and bringing influence into play requires spending it. 
Characters can gain influence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the 
cause of an organization, or demonstrating their power and heroism, at 
your discretion. As with inspiration, a character can choose to spend 
influence to gain advantage on a roll relevant to that influence.</p><p>Another
 way to handle influence is to treat it like renown (see chapter 1), 
allowing characters to gain renown at court and within various key 
factions.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="362" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Framing Events</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p79</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You

encounters that precede it while foreshadowing encounters yet to come.</p><p>An
 encounter has one of three possible outcomes: the characters succeed, 
the characters partly succeed, or the characters fail. The encounter

deliver a priceless relic to a remote monastery, each encounter along 
the way is an opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves 
the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might see the adventurers 
accosted by enemies determined to steal the relic, or by monsters that 
are constantly threatening the monastery.</p><p>Some players create 
their own objectives, which is to be expected and encouraged. It is, 
after all, as much the players' campaign as yours. For example, a

 party can't benefit from a short rest between parts of a multipart 
encounter, so they won't be able to spend Hit Dice to regain hit points 
or recover any abilities that require a short rest to regain. As a rule,
 if the adjusted XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is

 can build an encounter if you know its desired difficulty. The party's 
XP thresholds give you an XP budget that you can spend on monsters to 
build easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that 
groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base XP values 
would indicate (see step 4).</p><p>For example, using the party from 
step 2, you can build a medium encounter by making sure that the 
adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party's 
threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 XP (the party's 
threshold for a hard encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 
(such as a manticore or owlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that's one 
possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5
 times its base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have
 an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the 
party as well.</p><p>To assist with this approach, appendix B presents a list of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by challenge rating.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="404" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Adventuring Day</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p84</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Assuming
 typical adventuring conditions and average luck, most adventuring 
parties can handle about six to eight medium or hard encounters in a 
day. If the adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get 
through more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can handle fewer.</p><p>In
 the same way you figure out the difficulty of an encounter, you can use
 the XP values of monsters and other opponents in an adventure as a 
guideline for how far the party is likely to progress.</p><p>For each 
character in the party, use the Adventuring Day XP table to estimate how
 much XP that character is expected to earn in a day. Add together the 
values of all party members to get a total for the party's adventuring 
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP value for 
encounters the party can handle before the characters will need to take a
 long rest.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="405">Adventuring Day XP</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-6 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">Level</th><th class="col-6 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">Adjusted XP per Day per Character</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">1st</td><td class="col-6 text-center">300</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">2nd</td><td class="col-6 text-center">600</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">3rd</td><td class="col-6 text-center">1,200</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">4th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">1,700</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">5th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">3,500</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">6th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">4,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">7th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">5,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">8th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">6,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">9th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">7,500</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">10th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">9,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">11th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">10,500</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">12th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">11,500</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">13th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">13,500</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">14th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">15,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">15th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">18,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">16th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">20,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">17th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">25,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">18th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">27,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">19th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">30,000</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">20th</td><td class="col-6 text-center">40,000</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="406" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Short Rests</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p84</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>In

the way through the day.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="407" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Modifying Encounter Difficulty</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p84</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>An
 encounter can be made easier or harder based on the choice of location 
and the situation. Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step 
(from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have a drawback 
that their enemies don't. Reduce the difficulty by one step if the 
characters have a benefit that their enemies don't. Any additional 
benefit or drawback pushes the encounter one step in the appropriate 
direction. If the characters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two
 cancel each other out. Situational drawbacks include the following:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn't.</li><li class="rd__li ">The enemy has cover, and the party doesn't.</li><li class="rd__li ">The characters are unable to see the enemy.</li><li class="rd__li ">The characters are taking damage every round from some environmental effect or magical source, and the enemy isn't.</li><li class="rd__li ">The
 characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst of scaling a sheer 
wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or otherwise in a situation that 
greatly hinders their mobility or makes them sitting ducks.</li></ul><p>Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except that they benefit the characters instead of the enemy.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="408" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Fun Combat Encounters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p85</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The following features can add more fun and suspense to a combat encounter:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Terrain

 characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon complex, they are bound
 to encounter the unexpected. Random encounters are a way to deliver the
 unexpected. They are usually presented in the form of a table. When a 
random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult the table to 
determine what the party encounters.</p><p>Some players and DMs view 
random encounters in an adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed 
random encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes:</p><ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle"><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Create urgency.</span>
 Adventurers don't tend to dawdle if the threat of random encounters is 
hanging over their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters creates a 
strong incentive to look for a safe place to rest. (Rolling dice behind 
the DM screen can often accomplish this even without an actual 
encounter.)</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Establish atmosphere.</span>
 The appearance of thematically linked creatures as random encounters 
helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere for an adventure. For 
example, an encounter table filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, 
and zombies creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to 
prepare for battle with even more powerful creatures of the night.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Drain character resources.</span>
 Random encounters can drain the party's hit points and spell slots, 
leaving the adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable. This 
creates tension, as players are forced to make decisions based on the 
fact that their characters aren't at full strength.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Provide assistance.</span>
 Some random encounters can benefit the characters instead of hindering 
or harming them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the adventurers
 with useful information or assistance when they need it most.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Add interest.</span>
 Random encounters can reveal details about your world. They can 
foreshadow danger or provide hints that will help the adventurers 
prepare for the encounters to come.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Reinforce campaign themes.</span>
 Random encounters can remind the players of the major themes of the 
campaign. For example, if your campaign features an ongoing war between 
two nations, you might design random encounter tables to reinforce the 
ever-present nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables 
might include bedraggled troops returning from battle, refugees fleeing 
invading forces, heavily guarded caravans full of weapons, and lone 
messengers on horseback riding for the front lines. While characters are
 in hostile territory, the tables might include battlefields littered 
with the recently slain, armies of evil humanoids on the march, and 
improvised gibbets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee the
 conflict.</p></li></ul><p>Random encounters should never be tiresome to
 you or your players. You don't want the players to feel as if they 
aren't making progress because another random encounter brings their 
progress to a halt whenever they try to move forward. Likewise, you 
don't want to spend time distracted by random encounters that add 
nothing to the adventure narrative or that interfere with the overall 
pace you're trying to set.</p><p>Not every DM likes to use random 
encounters. You might find that they distract from your game or are 
otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If random encounters don't
 work for you, don't use them.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="410" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Triggering Random Encounters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p85</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Because
 you want random encounters to build on the intended narrative of a game
 session, not compete with it, you should choose the placement of those 
encounters carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of the 
following circumstances:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The players are getting off track and slowing down the game.</li><li class="rd__li ">The characters stop for a short or long rest.</li><li class="rd__li ">The characters are undertaking a long, uneventful journey.</li><li class="rd__li ">The characters draw attention to themselves when they should be keeping a low profile.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="411" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Checking for Random Encounters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p86</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You
 decide when a random encounter happens, or you roll. Consider checking 
for a random encounter once every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once
 during the day and once during a long rest-whatever makes the most 
sense based on how active the area is.</p><p>If you roll, do so with a <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;d20&quot;}">d20</span>.
 If the result is 18 or higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll
 on an appropriate random encounter table to determine what the 
adventurers meet, re-rolling if the die result doesn't make sense given 
the circumstances.</p><p>Random encounter tables might be provided as 
part of the adventure you're running, or you can use the information in 
this chapter to build your own. Creating your own tables is the best way
 to reinforce the themes and flavor of your home campaign.</p><p>Not 
every run-in with another creature counts as a random encounter. 
Encounter tables don't usually include rabbits hopping through the 
undergrowth, harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or average 
citizens walking through the streets of a city. Random encounter tables 
present obstacles and events that advance the plot, foreshadow important
 elements or themes of the adventure, and provide fun distractions.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="412" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating Random Encounter Tables</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p86</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Creating
 your own random encounter tables is straightforward. Determine what 
sort of encounters might occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the 
likelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then arrange the 
results. An "encounter" in this case could be a single monster or NPC, a
 group of monsters or NPCs, a random event (such as an earth tremor or a
 parade), or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a message 
scrawled on a wall).</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="413" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Assemble Your Encounters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p86</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Once
 you've established a location through which the adventurers are likely 
to pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make a list of 
creatures that might be found wandering there. If you're not sure which 
creatures to include, appendix B has lists of monsters organized by 
terrain type.</p><p>For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table that
 includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites, dryads, satyrs, 
blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant owls, and a unicorn. If elves
 inhabit the forest, the table might also include elf druids and elf 
scouts. Perhaps gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and 
hyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players. Another fun 
surprise would be a wandering predator, such as a displacer beast that 
likes to hunt blink dogs.</p><p>The table could also use a few random 
encounters of a less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned trees 
(the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered elven statue, and a plant 
with glowing berries that turn creatures invisible when ingested.</p><p>When
 choosing monsters for a random encounter table, try to imagine why the 
monsters would be encountered outside their lairs. What is each monster 
up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for something? Also 
consider whether a creature is moving stealthily as it travels through 
the area.</p><p>As with planned encounters, random encounters are more 
interesting when they happen in memorable locations. Outdoors the 
adventurers might be crossing a forest clearing when they encounter a 
unicorn or be pushing through a dense section of forest when they come 
across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, characters might discover 
an oasis haunted by wights or a rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon
 perches.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="414" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Probabilities</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p86</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A random encounter table can be created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d6&quot;}">1d6</span>
 for one of six possible encounters) to complicated (roll percentile 
dice, modify for time of day, and cross-index the modified number with 
the dungeon level). The sample encounter table presented here uses a 
range of 2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d12 + 1d8&quot;}">1d12 + 1d8</span>.
 The probability curve ensures that encounters appearing in the middle 
of the table are more likely to occur than encounters placed at the 
beginning or end of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d100&quot;,&quot;successThresh&quot;:1}">1 percent</span> chance of either), while each of the rolls from 9 to 13 occurs a little over 8 percent of the time.</p><p>The
 Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example of a random encounter 
table that implements the ideas mentioned above. Creature names in bold

random encounter, since most players consider this ending to be an 
unsatisfying one.</p><p>Not all random encounters with monsters need to 
be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of adventurers could have a
 random encounter with a young dragon circling above a forest canopy in 
search of a quick meal, but the characters should have the option to 
hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon spots them. Similarly, the
 party might encounter a stone giant roaming the hills, but it might 
have no intention of harming anyone. In fact, it might shy away from the
 party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might attack only 
characters who annoy it.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="417" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating Nonplayer Characters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p88</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A

the dragon counting gold in its cavernous lair.</p><p>This chapter shows

attention you would give to a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as 
ideals, bonds, flaws, and secrets. If a beholder mastermind is behind 
the criminal activities in a city, don't rely solely on the entry in the
 Monster Manual to describe the creature's appearance and personality. 
Take the time to give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of 
appearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw.</p><p>As an 
example, consider the Xanathar, a beholder that runs extensive criminal 
operations in the city of Waterdeep. The Xanathar's spherical body is 
covered in leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its 
eyestalks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some of the stalks
 have magic rings on them. The Xanathar's speech is slow and deliberate,
 and it prefers to turn its central eye away from creatures it speaks 
to. Like all beholders, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though it 
understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions.</p><p>The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to access virtually any location within or under the city.</p><p>The
 Xanathar's ideal is greed. It craves powerful magic items and surrounds
 itself with gold, platinum, and precious gems. Its bond is to its 
lair-an elaborate cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers 
of Waterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors and cherishes 
above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for exotic pleasures: finely 
prepared foods, scented oils, and rare spices and herbs.</p><p>Establishing
 this information allows you to play the Xanathar as more than an 
ordinary beholder. The complexities of the creature's characterization 
create more memorable interaction and interesting story possibilities.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="446" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">NPC Statistics</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p92</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When

 might join the adventuring party because they want a share of the loot 
and are willing to accept an equal share of the risk, or they might 
follow the adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, or love.
 Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you can transfer control to the 
players. Even if a player controls an NPC, it's up to you to make sure 
the NPC is portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not just as
 a servant that the players can manipulate for their own benefit.</p><p>Any
 NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as a party member and earns a
 full share of experience points. When determining the difficulty of a 
combat encounter (see chapter 3), make sure to include all NPC party 
members.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="453" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Low-Level Followers</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p92</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your
 campaign might allow player characters to take on lower-level NPCs as 
followers. For example, a paladin might have a 1st-level paladin as a 
squire, a wizard might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a 
cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as an acolyte, 
and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as an understudy.</p><p>One 
advantage of allowing lower-level characters to join the party is that 
players have backup characters if their main characters take time off, 
retire, or die. One disadvantage is that you and your players have more 
party members to account for.</p><p>Since lower-level NPC party members 
receive equal party shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly 
than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such experienced 
masters), and might eventually catch up to them. It also means the 
adventurers' advancement is slowed somewhat, as they must share their XP
 with an NPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden.</p><p>Powerful
 monsters that are an appropriate challenge for higher-level characters 
can deal enough damage to instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level 
follower. The adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources 
protecting lower-level NPC party members and to provide healing when 
this protection fails.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="454" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adventurer NPCs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p93</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>If
 you don't have enough players to form a full party, you can use NPCs to
 fill out the ranks. These NPCs should be the same level as the 
lowest-level adventurer in the party and built (either by you or your 
players) using the character creation and advancement rules in the 
Player's Handbook. It's easiest on you if you let the players create and
 run these supporting characters.</p><p>Encourage players to roleplay 
supporting characters as true to the NPCs' personality traits, ideals, 
bonds, and flaws as possible, so that they don't come across as 
automatons. If you don't feel that an NPC is being portrayed well, you 
can take control of the NPC, give it to another player, or simply have 
the NPC leave the party.</p><p>NPC supporting characters are easier to 
play if you limit their class options. Good candidates for supporting 
characters include a cleric with the Life domain, a fighter with the 
Champion archetype, a rogue with the Thief archetype, and a wizard 
specializing in Evocation.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="455" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Optional Rule: Loyalty</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p93</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Loyalty
 is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party 
member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even
 those he or she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party member who is 
abused or ignored is likely to abandon or betray the party, whereas an 
NPC who owes a life debt to the characters or shares their goals might 
fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be role played or represented 
by this rule.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="456" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Loyalty Score</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p93</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>An
 NPC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC's 
maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all

 NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and

 NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to help 
fellow party members. If the NPC's loyalty score is between 1 and 10, 
its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts 
in the party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party 
(attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to 
bring about the party's downfall.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="458" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Contacts</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p93</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Contacts

nonplayer characters contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters 
are likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of their 
adventuring careers.</p><p>A name and a few choice details are all you

 patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, providing help or

patron has a vested interest in the adventurers' success and doesn't 
need to be persuaded to help them. A patron might be a retired 
adventurer who seeks younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a 
mayor who knows that the town guard can't handle a dragon demanding 
tribute.</p><p>A sheriff becomes a patron by offering a bounty for

 can pay NPCs to provide services in a variety of circumstances. 
Information on hirelings appears in chapter 5, "Equipment," of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.</p><p>Hireling
 NPCs rarely become important in an adventure, and most require little 
development. When adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town or 
need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger is a hireling, and the 
adventurers might never even converse with that NPC or learn his or her 
name. A ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is also a 
hireling, but such a character has the potential to turn into an ally, a
 patron, or even an enemy as the adventure unfolds.</p><p>When the 
adventurers hire an NPC for long-term work, add the cost of that NPC's 
services to the characters' lifestyle expenses. See the "Additional 
Expenses" section of chapter 6, "Between Adventures," for more 
information.</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="461" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Extras</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p94</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Extras are the characters and creatures in the background that the main characters rarely, if ever, interact with.</p><p>Extras
 might be elevated to more important roles by virtue of adventurers

 to create NPCs with classes and levels, the same way you create player 
characters. The class options below let you create two specific 
villainous archetypes: the evil high priest and the evil knight or anti 
paladin.</p><p>The Death Domain is an additional domain choice for evil 
clerics, and the Oathbreaker offers an alternative path for paladins who
 fall from grace. A player can choose one of these options with your 
approval.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="468" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cleric: Death Domain</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p96</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as 
the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as
 Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death 
knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain 
also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or 
Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the 
underworld (Hades and Hel).</p><p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#cleric_phb,state:sub-death-dmg=b1,fltsource:clear,flstmiscellaneous:clear" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="classes.html" data-vet-source="phb" data-vet-hash="cleric_phb,state:sub-death-dmg=b1" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Death Domain classes page entry</a> for more information.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="469" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Paladin: Oathbreaker</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p97</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>An

 D&amp;D adventures revolve around a dungeon setting. Dungeons in 
D&amp;D include great halls and tombs, subterranean monster lairs, 
labyrinths riddled with death traps, natural caverns extending for miles
 beneath the surface of the world, and ruined castles.</p><p>Not every 
adventure takes place in a dungeon. A wilderness trek across the Desert 
of Desolation or a harrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of 
Dread can be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the great 
outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search of prey, tribes of 
hobgoblins pour forth from their grim fortresses to wage war against 
their neighbors, ogres plunder farmsteads for food, and monstrous 
spiders drop from the web-shrouded canopies of trees.</p><p>Within a 
dungeon, adventurers are constrained by walls and doors around them, but
 in the wilderness, adventurers can travel in almost any direction they 
please. Therein lies the key difference between dungeon and wilderness: 
it's much easier to predict where the adventuring party might go in the 
dungeon because the options are limited-less so in the wilderness.</p><p>Villages,
 towns, and cities are cradles of civilization in a dangerous world, but
 they too offer opportunities for adventure. Encounters with monsters 
might seem unlikely within a city's walls, but urban settings have their
 own villains and perils. Evil, after all, takes many forms, and urban 
settings aren't always the safe havens they seem to be.</p><p>This 
chapter provides an overview of these three environments plus a few 
unusual environments, taking you through the process of creating an 
adventure location, with plenty of random tables to inspire you.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="471" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dungeons</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p99</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Some
 dungeons are old strongholds abandoned by the folk who built them. 
Others are natural caves or weird lairs carved out by foul monsters. 
They attract evil cults, monster tribes, and reclusive creatures. 
Dungeons are also home to ancient treasures: coins, gems, magic items, 
and other valuables hidden away in the darkness, often guarded by traps 
or jealously kept by the monsters that have collected them.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="472" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Building a Dungeon</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p99</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 you set out to create a dungeon, think about its distinctive qualities.

 dungeon reflects its creators. A lost temple of the yuan-ti, choked by 
overgrown jungle plants, might feature ramps instead of stairs. Caverns 
carved by a beholder's disintegration eye ray have walls that are 
unnaturally smooth, and the beholder's lair might include vertical 
shafts connecting different levels. Amphibious monsters such as kuo-toa 
and aboleths use water to protect the innermost reaches of their lairs 
from air-breathing intruders.</p><p>Details bring a dungeon setting's 
personality to life. Great bearded faces might be carved on the doors of
 a dwarven stronghold and might be defaced by the gnolls who live there 
now. Spiderweb decorations, torture chambers, and slave pens might be 
common features in a vault built by drow, telling something about that 
location and its occupants.</p><p>The Dungeon Creator table includes 
creatures that typically build dungeons. You can choose a creator from 
the table or roll randomly, or choose some other dungeon builder 
appropriate for your campaign.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="477">Dungeon Creator</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 a dungeon's creators depart, anyone or anything might move in. 
Intelligent monsters, mindless dungeon scavengers, predators and prey 
alike can be drawn to dungeons.</p><p>The monsters in a dungeon are more
 than a collection of random creatures that happen to live near one 
another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and predators can coexist in a 
complex ecology, alongside intelligent creatures who share living space 
through elaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and 
bloodshed.</p><p>Characters might be able to sneak into a dungeon, ally 
with one faction, or play factions against each other to reduce the 
threat of the more powerful monsters. For example, in a dungeon 
inhabited by mind flayers and their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers 
might try to incite the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears to revolt 
against their illithid masters.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="495" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dungeon Factions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p101</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group of intelligent 
humanoids, whether a tribe of orcs that have taken over a cavern complex
 or a gang of trolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times, 
particularly in larger dungeons, multiple groups of creatures share 
space and compete for resources.</p><p>For example, orcs that dwell in 
the mines of a ruined dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against 
the hobgoblins that hold the citadel's upper tiers. Mind flayers that 
have established a colony in the lowest levels of the mines could 
manipulate and dominate key hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the 
orcs. And all the while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and plots 
to slay the mind flayers, then enslave whatever creatures are left.</p><p>It's
 easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of encounters, with the 
adventurers kicking down door after door and killing whatever lies 
beyond. But the ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon 
provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle interaction. Dungeon 
denizens are used to striking unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a 
wild card that canny monsters seek to exploit.</p><p>Intelligent 
creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether as simple as short-term 
survival or as ambitious as claiming the entire dungeon as the first 
step in founding an empire. Such creatures might approach adventurers 
with an offer of alliance, hoping to prevent the characters from laying 
waste to their lair and to secure aid against their enemies. Bring the 
NPC leaders of such groups to life as described in chapter 4, fleshing 
out their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use those elements to 
shape a response to the arrival of adventurers in their territory.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="496" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dungeon Ecology</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p102</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>An
 inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The creatures that live there 
need to eat, drink, breathe, and sleep, just as creatures in the 
wilderness do. Predators need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent 
creatures search for lairs offering the best combination of air, food, 
water, and security. Keep these factors in mind when designing a dungeon
 you want the players to believe in. If a dungeon doesn't have some 
internal logic to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make 
reasonable decisions within that environment.</p><p>For example, 
characters who find a pool of fresh water in a dungeon might make the 
logical assumption that many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon 
come to that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush at the 
pool. Likewise, locked doors-or even doors that require hands to 
open-can restrict the movement of some creatures. If all the doors in a 
dungeon are closed, the players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or
 stirges they repeatedly encounter manage to survive.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="497" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Encounter Difficulty</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p102</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You
 might be inclined to increase the encounter difficulty as the 
adventurers descend deeper into the dungeon, as a way to keep the 
dungeon challenging as the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the 
tension. However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a grind. A 
better approach is to include encounters of varying difficulty 
throughout. The contrast between easy and hard encounters, as well as 
simple and complex encounters, encourages characters to vary their 
tactics and keeps the encounters from seeming too similar.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="498" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mapping a Dungeon</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p102</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Every
 dungeon needs a map showing its layout. The dungeon's location, 
creator, purpose, history, and inhabitants should give you a starting 
point for designing your dungeon map. If you need further inspiration, 
you can find maps that have been made freely available for use on the 
Internet, or even use a map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you
 can borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly generate a 
dungeon complex using the tables presented in appendix A.</p><p>A 
dungeon can range in size from a few chambers in a ruined temple to a 
huge complex of rooms and passages extending hundreds of feet in all 
directions.</p><p>The adventurers' goal often lies as far from the 
dungeon entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve deeper 
underground or push farther into the heart of the complex.</p><p>A 
dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, with each square on the 
paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with 
miniatures on a grid, you might prefer a scale where each square 
represents 5 feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot 
grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you draw your map, keep 
the following points in mind:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a dungeon less predictable.</li><li class="rd__li ">Think
 in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms, ledges, balconies, pits,
 and other changes of elevation make a dungeon more interesting and make
 combat encounters in those areas more challenging.</li><li class="rd__li ">Give
 the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you want to stress that the 
dungeon's builders were extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can
 be commonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections of the dungeon 
from each other. Past earthquakes might have opened chasms within a 
dungeon, splitting rooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles.</li><li class="rd__li ">Incorporate
 natural features into even a constructed dungeon. An underground stream
 might run through the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation
 in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating features such as 
bridges and drains.</li><li class="rd__li ">Add multiple entrances and 
exits. Nothing gives the players a stronger sense of making real 
decisions than having multiple ways to enter a dungeon.</li><li class="rd__li ">Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players who take the time to search for them.</li></ul><p>If you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch, see appendix A.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="499" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dungeon Features</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p102</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 atmosphere and physical characteristics of dungeons vary as widely as 
their origins. An old crypt might have stone walls and loose wooden

 past eruptions, doors of magically reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur,

 dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have walls of solid rock, hewn

 portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or iron, reinforced 
with one or more horizontal bands. It blocks a passage or archway until 
it is raised up into the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit 
of a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards 
to watch the area beyond and make ranged attacks or cast spells through 
it.</p><p>Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action. If a 
character can't reach the winch (usually because it is on the other side
 of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis or bending its bars far 
enough apart to pass through them requires a successful Strength check.

the thickness of its bars. To determine an appropriate DC, see chapter

caverns where sightless creatures hunt.</p><p>The light of a torch or 
lantern helps a character see over a short distance, but other creatures
 can see that light source from far away. Bright light in an environment
 of total darkness can be visible for miles, though a clear line of 
sight over such a distance is rare underground. Even so, adventurers 
using light sources in a dungeon often attract monsters, just as dungeon
 features that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi to the glow of

 the dungeons and settlements of your campaign world lie meadows, 
forests, deserts, mountain ranges, oceans, and other tracts of 
wilderness waiting to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life 
can be a fun part of your game, both for you and your players.</p><p>The following two approaches work particularly well.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="517" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Travel-Montage Approach</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p106</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Sometimes
 the destination is more important than the journey. If the purpose of a
 wilderness trek is to get the characters to where the real adventure 
happens, gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for encounters 
along the way. Just as movies use travel montages to convey long and 
arduous journeys in a matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of 
descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in your 
players' minds before moving on.</p><p>Describe the journey as vividly 
as you like, but keep the forward momentum. "You walk for several miles 
and encounter nothing of interest" is okay, but far less evocative and 
memorable than, "A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel 
north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, 
the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but 
otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary." The trick is to 
focus on a few details that reinforce the desired mood rather than 
describe everything down to the last blade of grass.</p><p>Call 
attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, a rocky outcropping 
that offers a breathtaking view over the tops of the surrounding trees, 
an area where the forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also 
describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of a faraway 
monster, the stench of burned wood, or the sweet aroma of flowers in an 
elven forest.</p><p>In addition to evocative language, visual aids can 
help set the scene for the characters' travels. Image searches on the 
Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes (in fact, that's a good
 phrase to search for) both real and fantastical. As striking as 
real-world scenery can be, wilderness travel can be used to remind the 
players that their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, 
spice up your descriptions with some truly magical element. A forest 
might be home to tiny dragonets instead of birds, or its trees might be 
festooned with giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these 
elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can break your 
players' sense of immersion in the world. A single fantastic element 
within an otherwise realistic and memorable landscape is enough.</p><p>Use
 the landscape to set the mood and tone for your adventure. In one 
forest, close-set trees shroud all light and seem to watch the 
adventurers as they pass.</p><p>In another, sunlight streams through the
 leaves above and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs of 
corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and rocks covered with 
slimy brown moss-can be a signal that the adventurers are drawing close 
to the site of evil power that is their destination or can provide clues
 to the nature of the threats to be found there.</p><p>Specific 
wilderness locations might have their own special features. For example,
 the Spirit Forest and the Spider haunt Woods might feature different 
kinds of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different weather, 
and different random encounter tables.</p><p>Finally, a wilderness trek 
can be enhanced by calling attention to the weather. "You spend the next
 three days crossing the swamp" sounds less harrowing than, "You spend 
the next three days trudging through knee-deep mud-the first two days 
and nights in the pouring rain, and then another day under the beating 
sun, with swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood."</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="518" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Hour-by-Hour Approach</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p106</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Sometimes
 the journey deserves as much time and attention as the destination. If 
wilderness travel features prominently in your adventure and isn't 
something you want to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive 
overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; you'll need to 
know the party's marching order and have encounters at the ready.</p><p>Let your players determine the party's marching order (see the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 for more information). Characters in the front rank are likely to be 
the first to notice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the ones 
responsible for navigating. Characters in the back rank are usually 
responsible for making sure that the party isn't being followed. 
Encourage characters in the middle ranks to do something other than 
blindly trudge along behind the front-rank characters. The <i>Player's Handbook</i> suggests activities such as mapmaking and foraging for food.</p><p>Wilderness
 journeys typically feature a combination of planned encounters 
(encounters that you prepare ahead of time) and random encounters 
(encounters determined by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might
 need a map of the location where the encounter is set to occur, such as
 a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other memorable location. 
Random encounters tend to be less location-specific. The fewer planned 
encounters you have, the more you'll need to rely on random encounters 
to keep the journey interesting. See chapter 3 for guidelines on 
creating your own random encounter tables and when to check for random 
encounters.</p><p>A good way to keep wilderness encounters from becoming
 stale is to make sure they don't all start and end the same way. In 
other words, if the wilderness is your stage and your adventure is the 
play or movie, think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, and 
try to stage each one in a slightly different way to keep your players' 
interest. If one encounter comes at the adventurers from the front, the 
next one might come at them from above or behind. If an encounter 
features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the party's pack 
animals might get the first indication that monsters are near when a 
pony whickers nervously. If an encounter features loud monsters, the 
party might have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of 
monsters might attack the party on sight, and another might allow safe 
passage for food.</p><p>Reward characters for searching while they 
travel by providing things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks, 
abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to your world, 
foreshadow future encounters or events, or provide hooks for further 
adventures. A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to play 
out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes long periods with no 
encounters, use the travel-montage approach to bridge gaps between 
encounters.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="519" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mapping a Wilderness</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p108</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 contrast to a dungeon, an outdoor setting presents seemingly limitless 
options. The adventurers can move in any direction over a trackless 
desert or an open grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the 
possible locations and events that might make up a wilderness campaign? 
What if you design an encounter in a desert oasis, but the characters 
miss the oasis because they wander off course? How do you avoid creating
 a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging across a rocky 
wasteland?</p><p>One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in the 
same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most wide-open terrain 
presents clear pathways. Roads seldom run straight because they follow 
the contours of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest 
routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges channel travel in 
certain directions. Mountain ranges present forbidding barriers 
traversed only by remote passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals 
favored routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have discovered 
areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to traverse than shifting 
sand.</p><p>If the party veers off track, you might be able to relocate 
one or more of your planned encounters elsewhere on the map to ensure 
that the time spent preparing those encounters doesn't go to waste.</p><p>Chapter
 1 discusses the basics of creating a wilderness map at three different 
scales to help you design your world and the starting area of your 
campaign. Especially when you get down to province scale (1 hex = 1 
mile), think about paths of travel-roads, passes, ridges and valleys, 
and so on-that can guide character movement across your map.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="520" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Movement on the Map</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p108</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Narrate
 wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate to the map you're 
using. If you're tracking hour-by-hour movement on a province-scale map 
(1 hex = 1 mile), you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. At 
this scale, you can assume that the characters find a noteworthy 
location when they enter its hex unless the site is specifically hidden.
 The characters might not walk directly up to the front door of a ruined
 castle when they enter a hex, but they can find old paths, outlying 
ruins, and other signs of its presence in the area.</p><p>If you're 
tracking a journey of several days on a kingdom-scale map (1 hex = 6 
miles), don't bother with details too small to appear on your map. It's 
enough for the players to know that on the third day of their journey, 
they cross a river and the land starts rising before them, and that they
 reach the mountain pass two days later.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="521" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Wilderness Features</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p108</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>No

 you draw a map for a settlement in your game, don't worry about the 
placement of every building, and concentrate instead on the major 
features.</p><p>For a village, sketch out the roads, including trade 
routes leading beyond the village and roads that connect outlying farms 
to the village center. Note the location of the village center. If the 
adventurers visit specific places in the village, mark those spots on 
your map.</p><p>For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways as 
well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls and mark the locations of
 features you know will be important: the lord's keep, significant 
temples, and the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about 
the personality of each ward. Give the wards names reflecting their 
personalities, which also identify the kinds of trades that dominate the
 neighborhood (Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical 
characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site (the Lords' 
Quarter).</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="569" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Urban Encounters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p114</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Although
 they hold the promise of safety, cities and towns can be just as 
dangerous as the darkest dungeon. Evil hides in plain sight or in dark 
corners. Sewers, shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, 
dilapidated tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn into 
battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must learn to behave 
themselves, lest they attract unwanted attention from local authorities.</p><p>That said, characters who don't go looking for trouble can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement has to offer.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="570" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Law and Order</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p114</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Whether
 a settlement has a police force depends on its size and nature. A 
lawful, orderly city might have a city watch to maintain order and a 
trained militia to defend its walls, and a frontier town might rely on 
adventurers or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off 
attackers.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="571" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Trials</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p114</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>In
 most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates or local lords. 
Some trials are argued, with the conflicting parties or their advocates 
presenting precedent and evidence until the judge makes a decision, with
 or without the aid of spells or interrogation. Others are decided with a
 trial by ordeal or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused
 is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a trial and skip 
right to the sentencing.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="572" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sentences</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p114</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals awaiting trial, 
but few settlements have prisons to incarcerate convicted criminals. A

 shipwreck is a plot device that can be used sparingly to great effect, 
particularly if you want the characters to be washed ashore on some 
monster-infested island or (in the case of an airship) dropped in the 
middle of some exotic land. There aren't rules for determining when a 
shipwreck happens; it happens when you want or need it to happen.</p><p>Even
 the strongest seafaring ship can founder in a storm, run aground on 
rocks or reefs, sink during a pirate attack, or be dragged underwater by
 a sea monster. A storm or hungry dragon can lay waste to an airship 
just as easily. A shipwreck has the potential to change the direction of
 a campaign. It isn't, however, a particularly good way to kill off 
characters or end a campaign.</p><p>If you and your campaign conspire to
 wreck a ship on which the characters are traveling, it is assumed that 
the characters survive with the equipment they were wearing or carrying 
still in their possession. The fate of any NPCs and cargo aboard the 
wrecked ship is entirely up to you.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="604" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Random Encounters at Sea</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p118</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You

 A creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour for every 3 
hours it flies, and it can't fly for more than 9 hours per day. Thus, 
characters mounted on griffons (which have a flying speed of 80 feet) 
can travel at 8 miles per hour, covering 72 miles over 9 hours with two 
1-hour-long rests over the course of the day. Mounts that don't tire 
(such as a flying construct) aren't subject to this limitation.</p><p>As
 adventurers travel through the air, check for random encounters as you 
normally would. Ignore any result that indicates a non-flying monster,

stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip
 wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic 
traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches 
an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have 
more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents 
the trap from activating.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="619" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Detecting and Disabling a Trap</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p120</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Usually,
 some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters 
might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot 
the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from
 which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that 
points to a trap's presence.</p><p>A trap's description specifies the 
checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character 
actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="perception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Perception</span>) check against the trap's DC.

 score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in 
passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they 
might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move 
past it. You might call for an Intelligence (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="phb" data-vet-hash="thieves'%20tools_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">thieves' tools</a> to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="arcana_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Arcana</span>)
 check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks
 noted in the trap's description. The DCs are the same regardless of the
 check used. In addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most 
magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC for the ability 
check made when you use dispel magic.</p><p>In most cases, a trap's 
description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a 
character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, 
you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good 
planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to 
determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible 
action that the characters might attempt.</p><p>You should allow a 
character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an 
action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a 
character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has 
found the trigger and no check is required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a
 little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the 
chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its 
sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone 
in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the 
characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the
 chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a 
distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but 
the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p><p>Traps are 
often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or 
bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs
 need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such 
traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret 
door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="620" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Trap Effects</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p121</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of 
elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of

 traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a 
series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of 
dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.</p><p>When
 a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap's description 
includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, 
often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against 
intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce
 a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and 
disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.</p><p>For example, a trap that 
causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the 
trap's turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is 
completely flooded.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="624" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sample Traps</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p121</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> See the <a href="https://5e.tools/trapshazards.html#">traps and hazards page</a> for more information.</div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="625" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Between Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p125</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 campaign is much more than a series of adventures. It also includes the
 moments between them-the various distractions and side pursuits that 
engage the characters when they're not exploring the wilderness, 
plundering dungeons, and gallivanting around the multiverse on some epic
 quest.</p><p>The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between 
adventures, time for the characters to spend their treasure and pursue 
their goals. This downtime gives the characters an opportunity to sink 
their roots a little deeper into the world, building a personal 
investment in what happens to the people and places around them, which 
can, in turn, draw them into further adventures.</p><p>Chapter 5, "Equipment," of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 details the expenses that a character incurs for basic necessities, 
depending on the lifestyle the character chooses, from poverty to 
luxury. Chapter 8, "Adventuring," of that book describes some of the 
downtime activities they can pursue between adventures. This chapter 
fills in the gaps, describing the expenses of owning property and hiring
 NPCs, and a variety of additional downtime activities characters can 
pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers suggestions for linking
 adventures together and keeping track of events in your campaign.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="626" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Linking Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p125</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 campaign in the style of an episodic television show rarely needs story
 links between its adventures. Each adventure features its own villains,
 and once the characters complete the adventure, there are typically no 
loose plot threads. The next adventure presents an altogether different 
challenge having nothing to do with the adventure that preceded it. As 
the characters gain experience points, they become more powerful, as do 
the threats they must overcome. This kind of campaign is easy to run, 
since it requires little effort beyond finding or creating adventures 
appropriate for the party's level.</p><p>A campaign with a narrative 
lets the players feel as though their actions have far-reaching 
consequences. They're not just racking up experience points. A few 
simple modifications can help you overlay overarching elements to create
 a serialized campaign in which early adventures help set up later ones.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="627" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Using an Overarching Story</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p125</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>This
 section presents a couple of examples of overarching stories which 
have, over the years, fueled many classic D&amp;D campaigns.</p><p>The 
adventurers' goal in the first example is to amass the power they need 
to defeat a powerful enemy that threatens the world. Their goal in the 
second example is to defend something they care about by destroying 
whatever threatens it.</p><p>The two examples are, in effect, the same story (variations of the battle between good and evil) told in different ways.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="628" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Example 1: The Quest of Many Parts</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p125</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You
 can tie adventures together using an overarching goal that can be 
fulfilled only by first completing a series of related quests. For 
example, you could create a villain who can't be defeated until the 
characters explore nine dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside,
 with each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters and hazards to
 advance the adventurers two or three levels. The adventurers spend 
their whole careers fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally 
pursuing an epic quest to destroy the princes' monstrous progenitor. As 
long as every dungeon is unique and interesting, your players will 
appreciate the tight focus of the campaign.</p><p>In a similar type of 
quest campaign, the adventurers might need to collect fragments of an 
artifact that are scattered in ruins across the multiverse, before 
reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a cosmic threat.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="629" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Example 2: Agents of X</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p125</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You
 can also build a campaign around the idea that the adventurers are 
agents of something larger than themselves-a kingdom or secret 
organization, for example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the 
adventurers are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting whatever
 it is they serve.</p><p>The characters' overarching mission might be to
 explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances where they can 
and overcoming threats they encounter along the way. Their goal might be
 to find the ancient capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the 
realm of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile territory. 
The characters could be pilgrims in search of a holy site or members of a
 secret order dedicated to defending the last bastions of civilization 
in an ever-declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, 
striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil leaders and 
plundering its treasures.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="630" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Planting Adventure Seeds</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p125</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You
 can make a campaign feel like one story with many chapters by planting 
the seeds of the next adventure before the current one is finished. This
 technique can naturally moves the characters along to their next goal.</p><p>If
 you've planted a seed well, the characters have something else to do 
when they finish an adventure. Perhaps a character drinks from a magic 
fountain in a dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to the
 next quest. The party might find a cryptic or relic that, once its 
meaning or purpose is determined, points to a new destination. Perhaps 
an NPC warns the characters of impending danger or implores them for 
help.</p><p>The trick is to not distract the characters from the 
adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a future adventure 
requires finesse. The lure should be compelling, but not so irresistible
 that the players stop caring about what their characters are doing 
right now.</p><p>To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for
 the very end of your adventures, or insert them during periods of 
downtime.</p><p>Here are a few examples of ways in which an adventure seed can be revealed:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">On a villain's corpse, the characters find evidence that the villain was working for someone else.</li><li class="rd__li ">A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or something that might interest the characters.</li><li class="rd__li ">The
 characters are heading to a local tavern when they spot a wanted poster
 or a missing person poster (complete with the promise of a sizable 
reward).</li><li class="rd__li ">Members of the local militia or city 
watch put out the word that a crime has been committed, and they're 
looking for potential witnesses and suspects.</li><li class="rd__li ">The characters receive an anonymous letter that sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they were previously unaware.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="631" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Foreshadowing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p126</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Foreshadowing
 is an exercise in subtlety, involving the delicate planting of seeds 
for future adventures. Not all foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly 
if the clues are too subtle or if events conspire to take your campaign 
in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint at upcoming 
events and new threats in your campaign without making it obvious to 
players that you're telling them what the future holds. Here are a few 
examples:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol of a previously unknown organization engraved or written on it.</li><li class="rd__li ">A
 mad woman standing on a street corner spouts fragments of an ancient 
prophecy, while pointing a crooked finger at the characters.</li><li class="rd__li ">The
 king and queen announce the marriage of their son to the daughter of a 
neighboring monarch, but various factions oppose the union. Trouble is 
brewing.</li><li class="rd__li ">Bugbear scouts are making incursions 
into civilized lands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a 
hobgoblin warlord's invasion.</li><li class="rd__li ">A puppet show in a
 market square predicts a tragic outcome if two noble houses on the cusp
 of declaring war on each other refuse to reconcile.</li><li class="rd__li ">NPC
 adventurers in a city are being murdered in a similar yet unusual 
manner, hinting at a future threat to the player characters.</li></ul></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="632" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Campaign Tracking</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p126</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Consistent
 details bring your campaign to life, and continuity helps players 
imagine that their characters are living in a real world. If the 
adventurers frequent a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the 
building, and decor shouldn't change much from one visit to the next. 
That said, changes can occur as a result of the characters' actions or 
of actions they learn about. When the adventurers kill a monster, it 
stays dead, unless someone raises it. When they remove treasure from a 
room, it doesn't reappear the next time they enter—assuming it hasn't 
been stolen from them! If they leave a door open, it should stay open 
until someone closes it. No one's memory is infallible, so it pays to 
keep records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to keep track of 
open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. Events beyond the scope of a 
single adventure are best recorded in a notebook dedicated to your 
campaign.</p><p>Whether it's a physical book or an electronic file, such a record is a great way to keep your notes organized.</p><p>Your notebook might include any of the following elements.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="633" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Campaign Planner.</span></span> <p>Write

 campaign benefits when characters have time between adventures to 
engage in other activities. Allowing days, weeks, or months to pass 
between adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period of time 
and helps to manage the characters' level progression, preventing them 
from gaining too much power too quickly.</p><p>Allowing characters to 
pursue side interests between adventures also encourages players to 
become more invested in the campaign world. When a character owns a 
tavern in a village or spends time carousing with the locals, that 
character's player is more likely to respond to threats to the village 
and its inhabitants.</p><p>As your campaign progresses, your players' 
characters will not only become more powerful but also more influential 
and invested in the world. They might be inclined to undertake projects 
that require more time between adventures, such as building and 
maintaining a stronghold. As the party gains levels, you can add more 
downtime between adventures to give characters the time they need to 
pursue such interests. Whereas days or weeks might pass between 
low-level adventures, the amount of downtime between higher-level 
adventures might be measured in months or years.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="647" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">More Downtime Activities</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p128</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Chapter 8, "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#phb,8,downtime%20activities,0">Adventuring</a>," of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>

 Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine the contents of a 
large cache of treasure, the accumulated wealth of a large group of 
creatures (such as an orc tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of a
 single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure (such as a 
dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party after completing a quest 
for a benefactor. You can also split up a treasure hoard so that the 
adventurers don't find or receive it all at once.</p><p>When determining
 the contents of a hoard belonging to one monster, use the table that 
corresponds to that monster's challenge rating. When rolling to 
determine a treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, use 
the challenge rating of the monster that leads the group. If the hoard 
belongs to no one, use the challenge rating of the monster that presides
 over the dungeon or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a
 benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party's average 
level.</p><p>Every treasure hoard contains a random number of coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;d100&quot;}">d100</span>
 and consult the table to determine how many gemstones or art objects 
the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll to determine whether the 
hoard contains magic items.</p><p>As with the individual treasure 
tables, average values are given in parentheses. You can use an average 
value instead of rolling dice to save time.</p><p>If a treasure hoard 
seems too small, you can roll multiple times on the table. Use this 
approach for monsters that are particularly fond of amassing treasure. 
Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure are wealthier than normal. 
Always roll at least twice on the appropriate table and add the results 
together.</p><p>You can hand out as much or as little treasure as you 
want. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party finds treasure 
hoards amounting to seven rolls on the Challenge 0-4 table, eighteen 
rolls on the Challenge 5-10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11-16 
table, and eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="663">Treasure Hoard: Challenge 0—4</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false"></th><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">CP</th><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">SP</th><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">EP</th><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">GP</th><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">PP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-2 text-center"><b>Coins</b></td><td class="col-2 text-center"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered 
in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could 
rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in 
wondrous ways.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="681" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Rarity</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p135</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Each
 magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or 
legendary. Common magic items, such as a potion of healing, are the most
 plentiful. Some legendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are 
unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful 
items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of 
wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily 
created. Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities.</p><p>Rarity
 provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic 
items. Each rarity corresponds to character level, as shown in the Magic
 Item Rarity table. A character doesn't typically find a rare magic 
item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, rarity shouldn't 
get in the way of your campaign's story. If you want a <i>ring of invisibility</i> to fall into the hands of a 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will arise from that event.</p><p>If
 your campaign allows for trade in magic items, rarity can also help you
 set prices for them. As the DM, you determine the value of an 
individual magic item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided
 in the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable item, such as
 a potion or scroll, is typically half the value of a permanent item of 
the same rarity.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="682">Magic Item Rarity</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-4" data-rd-isroller="false">Rarity</th><th class="col-4" data-rd-isroller="false">Character Level</th><th class="col-4" data-rd-isroller="false">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-4">Common</td><td class="col-4">1st or higher</td><td class="col-4">50-100 gp</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Uncommon</td><td class="col-4">1st or higher</td><td class="col-4">101-500 gp</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Rare</td><td class="col-4">5th or higher</td><td class="col-4">501-5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Very rare</td><td class="col-4">11th or higher</td><td class="col-4">5,001-50,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td class="col-4">Legendary</td><td class="col-4">17th or higher</td><td class="col-4">50,001+ gp</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="683" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Buying and Selling</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p135</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Unless
 you decide your campaign works otherwise, most magic items are so rare 
that they aren't available for purchase. Common items, such as a potion 
of healing, can be procured from an alchemist, herbalist, or 
spellcaster. Doing so is rarely as simple as walking into a shop and 
selecting an item from a shelf. The seller might ask for a service, 
rather than coin.</p><p>In a large city with an academy of magic or a 
major temple, buying and selling magic items might be possible, at your 
discretion. If your world includes a large number of adventurers engaged
 in retrieving ancient magic items, trade in these items might be more 
common. Even so, it's likely to remain similar to the market for fine 
art in the real world, with invitation-only auctions and a tendency to 
attract thieves.</p><p>Selling magic items is difficult in most D&amp;D 
worlds primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer. Plenty of 
people might like to have a magic sword, but few of them can afford it. 
Those who can afford such an item usually have more practical things to 
spend on. See chapter 6, "Between Adventures," for one way to handle 
selling magic items.</p><p>In your campaign, magic items might be 
prevalent enough that adventurers can buy and sell them with some 
effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or auction houses in 
fantastical locations, such as the City of Brass, the planar metropolis 
of Sigil, or even in more ordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be 
highly regulated, accompanied by a thriving black market. Artificers 
might craft items for use by military forces or adventurers, as they do 
in the world of Eberron. You might also allow characters to craft their 
own magic items, as discussed in chapters 6.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="684" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Identifying a Magic Item</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p136</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Some
 magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, 
whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously. 
Whatever a magic item's appearance, handling the item is enough to give a
 character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering
 a magic item's properties isn't automatic, however.</p><p>The <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#identify_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="identify_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">identify</a>
 spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively,
 a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while 
being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the 
character learns the item's properties, as well as how to use them. 
Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster 
what the potion does.</p><p>Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its
 properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny
 letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#ring%20of%20feather%20falling_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="ring%20of%20feather%20falling_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">ring of feather falling</a>.</p><p>Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#ring%20of%20jumping_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="ring%20of%20jumping_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">ring of jumping</a>,
 you could say, "Your steps feel strangely springy." Perhaps the 
character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the 
character jumps unexpectedly high.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="685" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Variant: More Difficult Identification</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p136</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>If
 you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing

 magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their 
magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and 
certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is to be a
 spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell 
using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like. (If 
the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that creature 
has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.)</p><p>Without 
becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains 
only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. 
For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the 
benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of
 its magical properties.</p><p>Attuning to an item requires a creature 
to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical 
contact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the 
item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for
 a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate 
activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt 
fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an 
intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the
 item, including any necessary command words.</p><p>An item can be 
attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to
 no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a 
fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item 
first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an
 item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of 
protection at a time.</p><p>A creature's attunement to an item ends if 
the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if 
the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the 
creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature 
can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest 
focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="687" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cursed Items</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p138</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Some
 magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a
 user has stopped using an item. A magic item's description specifies 
whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including
 the identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might 
hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item's user when the 
curse's effects are revealed.</p><p>Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#remove%20curse_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="remove%20curse_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">remove curse</a> spell.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="688" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Magic Item Categories</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p139</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="689" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Armor</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p139</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Unless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function.</p><p>Some

 a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic

on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and 
rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to 
the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in 
hand.</p><p>In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a
 creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to 
be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.</p><p>Rare
 exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to 
fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it 
doesn't adjust. For example, armor made by the drow might fit elves 
only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and 
dwarf-shaped characters.</p><p>When a non-humanoid tries to wear an 
item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A
 ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike 
tail instead of legs has no way to wear magic boots.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="706" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Multiple Items of the Same Kind</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p141</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Use

 magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by 
expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible 
spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, 
and requires no components unless the item's description says otherwise.
 The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the 
user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. 
Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time,
 duration, or other parts of a spell.</p><p>Many items, such as potions,
 bypass the casting of the spell and confer the spell's effects. Such an
 item still uses the spell's duration unless the item's description says
 otherwise.</p><p>A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you 
to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the 
item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which 
one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting 
ability—perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature—your

 being fulfilled might try to kill the item's bearer.</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2 text-center" data-roll-min="6" data-roll-max="6">6</td><td class="col-10">Religious.
 This item was used in religious ceremonies dedicated to a particular

 to persuade its owner to donate it to a temple, steal the item for

deity.</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2 text-center" data-roll-min="7" data-roll-max="7">7</td><td class="col-10">Sinister.

 magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be 
possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware 
thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves 
like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and 
sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its 
wielder or a continual thorn in the side.</p><p>Most sentient items are 
weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable 
items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.</p><p>Sentient 
magic items function as NPCs under the DM's control. Any activated 
property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's. As 
long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the 
wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is 
strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn 
them against the wielder.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="734" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating Sentient Magic Items</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p214</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When

 artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, with its own 
origin and history. An artifact might have been created by gods or 
mortals of awesome power. It could have been created in the midst of a 
crisis that threatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, and
 carry the weight of that pivotal moment in history.</p><p>Some 
artifacts appear when they are needed most. For others, the reverse is 
true; when discovered, the world trembles at the ramifications of the 
find. In either case, introducing an artifact into a campaign requires 
forethought. The artifact could be an item that opposing sides are 
hoping to claim, or it might be something the adventurers need to 
overcome their greatest challenge.</p><p>Characters don't typically find
 artifacts in the normal course of adventuring. In fact, artifacts only 
appear when you want them to, for they are as much plot devices as magic
 items. Tracking down and recovering an artifact is often the main goal 
of an adventure. Characters must chase down rumors, undergo significant 
trials, and venture into dangerous, half-forgotten places to find the 
artifact they seek. Alternatively, a major villain might already have 
the artifact. Obtaining and destroying the artifact could be the only 
way to ensure that its power can't be used for evil.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="748" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Artifact Properties</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p219</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Each

 much as adventurers desire treasure, they often appreciate other forms 
of reward. This section presents a variety of ways that gods, monarchs, 
and other beings of power might recognize the characters' 
accomplishments, including supernatural gifts that give characters new 
capabilities; titles, lands, and other marks of prestige; and boons that
 are available only to adventurers who have reached 20th level.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="756" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Supernatural Gifts</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p227</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 supernatural gift is a special reward granted by a being or force of 
great magical power. Such supernatural gifts come in two forms: 
blessings and charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or a 
godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a powerful spirit, a 
location of ancient magic, or a creature that has legendary actions. 
Unlike a magic item, a supernatural gift isn't an object and doesn't 
require attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, which
 can be used one or more times.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="757" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Blessings</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p227</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 character might receive a blessing from a deity for doing something 
truly momentous-an accomplishment that catches the attention of both 
gods and mortals.</p><p>Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a 
blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he attempts to summon
 the Dragon Queen might.</p><p>A blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the following accomplishments:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god</li><li class="rd__li ">Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god</li><li class="rd__li ">Helping a god's favored servant complete a holy quest</li></ul><p>An
 adventurer might also receive a blessing in advance of a perilous 
quest. For example, a paladin could receive one before setting out on a 
quest to slay a terrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague
 sweeping the land.</p><p>A character should receive only a blessing 
that is useful to him or her, and some blessings come with expectations 
on the part of the benefactor. A god typically gives a blessing for a 
particular purpose, such as recovering a holy person's remains or 
toppling a tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing if a 
character fails to pursue that purpose or acts counter to it.</p><p>A 
character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or until it is 
taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike a magic item, such a 
blessing can't be suppressed by an antimagic field or similar effect.</p><p>Most
 adventurers go their entire lives without receiving even one of these 
blessings. There is no limit on the number of blessings a character can 
receive, but it should be rare for a character to have more than one at a
 time. Moreover, a character can't benefit from multiple instances of a 
blessing at the same time. For example, a character can't benefit from 
two instances of the Blessing of Health at once.</p><p>Example blessings

 charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can be received in a large 
variety of ways. For example, a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a
 dead archmage's spellbook might be infused with the magic of a charm, 
as might a character who solves a sphinx's riddle or drinks from a magic
 fountain. Legendary creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and 
unicorns, sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some explorers 
find themselves bearing the magic of a charm after discovering a 
long-lost location that is drenched in primeval magic.</p><p>Some charms
 can be used only once, and others can be used a specific number of 
times before vanishing. If a charm lets you cast a spell, you are able 
to do so without spending a spell slot or providing any components 
(verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can't be used in 
the area created by an antimagic field or a similar effect, and a 
charm's effects are susceptible to dispel magic and the like. But the 
charm itself can't be removed from a creature by anything short of 
divine intervention or the <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#wish_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="wish_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">wish</a> spell.</p><p>Example

 the most memorable reward for adventurers is the prestige that they 
acquire throughout a realm. Their adventures often earn them fame and 
power, allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to their 
descendants. Some lords and ladies began as commoners who ventured into 
the dangerous places of the world and made names for themselves through 
their brave deeds.</p><p>This section details the most common marks of 
prestige that adventures might acquire during a campaign. These marks 
are usually gained along with treasure, but sometimes they stand on 
their own.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="760" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Letters of Recommendation</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p228</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>When
 gold is in short supply, the adventurers' benefactor might provide them
 with a letter of recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a 
letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or scroll tube for
 safe transport, and it usually bears the signature and seal of whoever 
wrote it.</p><p>A letter of recommendation from a person of impeccable 
reputation can grant adventurers access to NPCs that they would 
otherwise have trouble meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or
 queen. Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one's person can 
help clear up "misunderstandings" with local authorities who might not 
otherwise take the adventurers at their word.</p><p>A letter of 
recommendation is worth only as much as the person who wrote it and 
offers no benefit in places where its writer holds no sway.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="761" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Medals</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p229</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Although
 they are often fashioned from gold and other precious materials, medals
 have an even greater symbolic value to those who award and receive 
them.</p><p>Medals are typically awarded by powerful political figures 
for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal is usually enough to earn the 
respect of those who understand its significance.</p><p>Different acts 
of heroism can warrant different kinds of medals. The King of Breland 
(in the Eberron campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor 
(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) to adventurers for 
defending Brelish citizens, while the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal 
made of gold and shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for 
eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their allegiance to 
the Brelish Crown by uncovering and defeating a plot to end the Treaty 
of Thronehold and reignite the Last War.</p><p>A medal doesn't offer a 
specific in-game benefit to one who wears it, but it can affect dealings
 with NPCs. For example, a character who proudly displays the Golden 
Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people within the 
kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the medal carries far less weight, 
except among allies of Breland's king.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="762" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Parcels of Land</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p229</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a royal letter 
affirming that the land has been granted as a reward for some service. 
Such land usually remains the property of the local ruler or ruling 
body, but is leased to a character with the understanding that it can be
 taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called into 
question.</p><p>A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one 
or more farms or villages on it already, in which case the recipient is 
pronounced lord or lady of the land and is expected to collect taxes, 
along with any other duties.</p><p>A character who receives a parcel of 
land is free to build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she 
may yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell or trade it
 without permission from the local ruler or ruling body.</p><p>Parcels 
of land make fine rewards for adventurers who are looking for a place to
 settle or who have family or some kind of personal investment in the 
region where the land is located.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="763" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Special Favors</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p229</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 reward might come in the form of a favor that the characters can call 
on at some future date. Special favors work best when the individual 
granting them is trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will 
do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when the time comes, 
short of breaking laws. A lawful evil NPC does the same, but only 
because a deal is a deal.</p><p>A neutral good or neutral NPC might pay 
off favors to protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is more 
concerned about doing right by the adventurers, honoring any obligations
 without worrying too much about personal risk or adherence to the law.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="764" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Special Rights</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p230</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 politically powerful person can reward characters by giving them 
special rights, which are usually articulated in some sort of official 
document. For example, characters might be granted special rights to 
carry weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or negotiate 
on a duke's behalf. They might earn the right to demand free room and 
board from any establishment within a particular community, or have the 
right to draft local militia to assist them as needed. Special rights 
last only as long as the legal document dictates, and such rights can be
 revoked if the adventurers abuse them.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="765" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Strongholds</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p230</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned adventurers who 
demonstrate unwavering fealty to a powerful political figure or ruling 
body, such as a king, a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A 
stronghold can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of a city
 to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While the stronghold is for 
the characters to govern as they see fit, the land on which it sits 
remains the property of the crown or local ruler. Should the characters 
prove disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or forced to 
relinquish custody of the stronghold.</p><p>As an additional reward, the
 individual bequeathing the stronghold might offer to pay its 
maintenance costs for a period of one or more months, after which the 
characters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 for more 
information on stronghold maintenance.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="766" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Titles</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p230</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense titles. A title
 often comes with a parcel of land (see above). For example, a character
 might be awarded the title Earl of Stormriver or Countess of Dun Fjord,
 along with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region of the
 same name.</p><p>A character can hold more than one title, and in a 
feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or distributed 
among) one's children. While a character holds a title, he or she is 
expected to act in a manner befitting that title. By decree, titles can 
be stripped away if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to 
question the character's loyalty or competence.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="767" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Training</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p231</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 character might be offered special training in lieu of a financial 
reward. This kind of training isn't widely available and thus is highly 
desirable. It presumes the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a 
retired adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a mentor. The 
trainer might be a reclusive wizard or haughty sorcerer who owes the 
queen a favor, the knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of a
 powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a remote mountaintop 
pagoda, a barbarian chieftain, a warlock living among nomads as a 
fortune-teller, or an absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known
 throughout the land.</p><p>A character who agrees to training as a 
reward must spend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 for more 
information on downtime activities). In exchange, the character is 
guaranteed to receive a special benefit. Possible training benefits 
include the following:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 epic boon is a special power available only to 20th level characters. 
Characters at that level gain such boons only if you want them to and 
only when you feel it's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after 
the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish something else 
particularly notable. A character might gain an epic boon after 
destroying an evil artifact, defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an 
incursion from the Outer Planes.</p><p>Epic boons can also be used as a 
form of advancement, a way to provide greater power to characters who 
have no more levels to gain. With this approach, consider awarding one 
epic boon to each character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above 
355,000 XP.</p><p>You determine which epic boon a character gains. 
Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character would put to use 
in future adventures. You can allow a player to select a boon for his or
 her character, subject to your approval.</p><p>Whatever boon a 
character ends up with, consider its place in your story and world. Many
 of the boons are extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation
 of a character into something resembling a demigod. The acquisition of a
 boon might visibly transform a character. For example, the eyes of a 
character with the Boon of Truesight might glow when he or she feels 
strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of High Magic might 
have faint motes of light glimmering around his or her head. Also, 
decide how the boon first appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously 
and mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest to bestow it?
 The bestowal of a boon can itself be an exciting scene in an adventure.</p><p>The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon says otherwise, a character can't gain it more than once.</p><p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/rewards.html#blankhash,flsttype:boon=1">Other Rewards</a> page for a list of available boons.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="769" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Alternatives to Epic Boons</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p230</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>You

 enable you and your players to have fun at the table. The rules serve 
you, not vice versa. There are the rules of the game, and there are 
table rules for how the game is played. For instance, players need to 
know what happens when one of them misses a session. They need to know 
whether to bring miniatures, any special rules you've decided to use, 
and how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its face can't

 players come to the gaming table with the same goal: to have a fun time
 together. This section gives recommendations for table rules you can 
establish to help meet that goal. Here are some fundamentals:</p><ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle"><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Foster respect.</span>
 Don't bring personal conflicts to the table or let disagreements

sensitive about it.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Avoid distractions.</span>
 Turn off the television and video games. If you have young children, 
hire a babysitter. Reducing distractions helps players stay in character
 and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players wandering away 
from the table and back, but some players prefer planned breaks.</p></li><li class="rd__li "><p class="rd__p-list-item"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Have snacks.</span> Decide before a session who will bring food and drink.

 how you feel about a player sharing information that his or her

 expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full view of everyone is a 
good starting point. If you see a player rolling and scooping the dice 
up before anyone else can see, encourage that player to be less 
secretive.</p><p>When a die falls on the floor, do you count it or 
reroll it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the book 
away and see where it lands, or reroll it?</p><p>What about you, the DM? Do you make your rolls in the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider the following:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">If you roll dice where the players can see, they know you're playing impartially and not fudging rolls.</li><li class="rd__li ">Rolling
 behind a screen keeps the players guessing about the strength of their 
opposition. When a monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher 
level than the characters, or are you rolling high numbers?</li><li class="rd__li ">Rolling
 behind a screen lets you fudge the results if you want to. If two 
critical hits in a row would kill a character, you could change the 
second critical hit into a normal hit, or even a miss. Don't distort die
 rolls too often, though, and don't let on that you're doing it. 
Otherwise, your players might think they don't face any real risks-or 
worse, that you're playing favorites.</li><li class="rd__li ">A roll 
behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For example, if a player 
thinks there might be someone invisible nearby and makes a Wisdom (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="perception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Perception</span>)
 check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if no one is 
there, making the player think someone is, indeed, hiding. Try not to 
overuse this trick.</li><li class="rd__li ">You might choose to make a 
roll for a player because you don't want the player to know how good the
 check total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness might be 
charmed and wants to make a Wisdom (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="insight_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Insight</span>)
 check, you could make the roll in secret for the player. If the player 
rolled and got a high number but didn't sense anything amiss, the player
 would be confident that the baroness wasn't charmed. With a low roll, a
 negative answer wouldn't mean much. A hidden roll allows uncertainty.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="776" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Rolling Attacks and Damage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p235</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Players

 might need to set a policy on rules discussions at the table. Some 
groups don't mind putting the game on hold while they hash out different
 interpretations of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and 
continue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue in play, make a
 note of it (a good task to delegate to a player) and return to the

 thinking means thinking about the game as a game. It's like when a 
character in a movie knows it's a movie and acts accordingly. For 
example, a player might say, "The DM wouldn't throw such a powerful 
monster at us!" or you might hear, "The read-aloud text spent a lot of 
time describing that door-let's search it again!" Discourage metagame 
thinking by giving players a gentle reminder: "What do your characters 
think?" You can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations that 
will be difficult for the characters and that might require negotiation 
or retreat to survive.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="779" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Missing Players</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p235</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>How should you deal with the characters of missing players? Consider these options:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Have
 another player run the missing player's character. The player running 
the extra character should strive to keep the character alive and use 
resources wisely.</li><li class="rd__li ">Run the character yourself. It's an extra burden for you, but it can work.</li><li class="rd__li ">Decide
 the character isn't there. Invent a good reason for the character to 
miss the adventure, perhaps by having him or her linger in town or 
continue a downtime activity. Leave a way for the character to rejoin 
the party when the player returns.</li><li class="rd__li ">Have the 
character fade into the background. This solution requires everyone to 
step out of the game world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the
 easiest solution. You act as if the character's not there, but don't 
try to come up with any in-game explanation for this absence. Monsters 
don't attack the character, who returns the favor. On returning, the 
player resumes playing as if he or she was never gone.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="780" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Small Groups</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p236</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Most
 of the time, each player runs one character. The game plays best that 
way, without overwhelming anyone. But if your group is small, players 
can control more than one character. Or you can fill out the group with 
NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, "Creating Nonplayer 
Characters." You can also make the characters more resilient by using 
the healing surge option in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop." 
Don't force a reluctant player to take on multiple characters, and don't
 show favoritism by allowing only one player to do so. If one character 
is the mentor of the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one
 character. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly talking to 
themselves in character, or avoiding roleplaying altogether.</p><p>Multiple
 characters can be a good idea in a game that features nonstop peril and
 a high rate of character death. If your group agrees to the premise, 
have each player keep one or two additional characters on hand, ready to
 jump in whenever the current character dies. Each time the main 
character gains a level, the backup characters do as well.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="781" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">New Players</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p236</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 a new player joins the group, allow the new player to create a 
character of a level equal to the lowest-level member of the party. The 
only exception to this guideline is when the new player is completely 
unfamiliar with the D&amp;D game. In that case, have that player start 
with a 1st-level character. If the rest of the party is significantly 
higher in level, consider taking a short break from the campaign and 
having everyone play a 1st-level character for a few sessions while the 
new player learns the ropes.</p><p>Integrating a new character into the 
group can be difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. 
The following approaches can help make it easier:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The new character is a friend or relative of one of the adventurers who has been searching for the group.</li><li class="rd__li ">The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other characters are fighting.

 are neutral arbiters. They can determine the outcome of an action 
without assigning any motivation to the DM and without playing 
favorites.

 DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. When a character attempts a
 task, the DM calls for a check and picks a DC. As a DM using this 
style, you can't rely on the characters succeeding or failing on any one
 check to move the action in a specific direction. You must be ready to 
improvise and react to a changing situation.</p><p>Relying on dice also 
gives the players the sense that anything is possible. Sure, it might 
seem unlikely that the party's halfling can leap on the ogre's back, 
pull a sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a lucky 
enough roll it just might work.</p><p>A drawback of this approach is 
that roleplaying can diminish if players feel that their die rolls, 
rather than their decisions and characterizations, always determine 
success.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="784" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ignoring the Dice</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p236</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>One
 approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some DMs use them only 
during combat, and determine success or failure as they like in other 
situations.</p><p>With this approach, the DM decides whether an action 
or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the players make their 
case, how thorough or creative they are, or other factors. For example, 
the players might describe how they search for a secret door, detailing 
how they tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find its trigger. That
 could be enough to convince the DM that they find the secret door 
without having to make an ability check to do so.</p><p>This approach 
rewards creativity by encouraging players to look to the situation 
you've described for an answer, rather than looking to their character 
sheet or their character's special abilities. A downside is that no DM 
is completely neutral. A DM might come to favor certain players or 
approaches, or even work against good ideas if they send the game in a 
direction he or she doesn't like. This approach can also slow the game 
if the DM focuses on one "correct" action that the characters must 
describe to overcome an obstacle.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="785" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Middle Path</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p236</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Many
 DMs find that using a combination of the two approaches works best. By 
balancing the use of dice against deciding on success, you can encourage
 your players to strike a balance between relying on their bonuses and 
abilities and paying attention to the game and immersing themselves in 
its world.</p><p>Remember that dice don't run your game-you do. Dice are
 like rules. They're tools to help keep the action moving. At any time, 
you can decide that a player's action is automatically successful. You 
can also grant the player advantage on any ability check, reducing the 
chance of a bad die roll foiling the character's plans. By the same 
token, a bad plan or unfortunate circumstances can transform the easiest
 task into an impossibility, or at least impose disadvantage.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="786" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Using Ability Scores</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p237</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 a player wants to do something, it's often appropriate to let the 
attempt succeed without a roll or a reference to the character's ability
 scores. For example, a character doesn't normally need to make a 
Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a Charisma check to 
order a mug of ale. Only call for a roll if there is a meaningful 
consequence for failure. When deciding whether to use a roll, ask 
yourself two questions:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that there should be no chance of failure?</li><li class="rd__li ">Is a task so inappropriate or impossible-such as hitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work?</li></ul><p>If
 the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is 
appropriate. The following sections provide guidance on determining 
whether to call for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw; how 
to assign DCs; when to use advantage and disadvantage; and other related
 topics.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="787" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ability Checks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p237</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>An
 ability check is a test to see whether a character succeeds at a task 
that he or she has decided to attempt. The Player's Handbook includes 
examples of what each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks 
table summarizes that material for easy reference.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="788" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Multiple Ability Checks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p237</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Sometimes
 a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some 
cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it 
takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should 
eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a 
character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to 
complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount 
of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task 
into a successful one.</p><p>In other cases, failing an ability check 
makes it impossible to make the same check to do the same thing again. 
For example, a rogue might try to trick a town guard into thinking the 
adventurers are undercover agents of the king. If the rogue loses a 
contest of Charisma (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>) against the guard's Wisdom (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="insight_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Insight</span>),
 the same lie told again won't work. The characters can come up with a 
different way to get past the guard or try the check again against 
another guard at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial
 failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="789">Ability Checks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-1" data-rd-isroller="false">Ability</th><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Used for...</th><th class="col-8" data-rd-isroller="false">Example Uses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-1">Strength</td><td class="col-3">Physical force and athleticism</td><td class="col-8">Smash down a door, move a boulder, use a spike to wedge a door shut</td></tr><tr><td class="col-1">Dexterity</td><td class="col-3">Agility, reflexes, and balance</td><td class="col-8">Sneak past a guard, walk along a narrow ledge, wriggle free from chains</td></tr><tr><td class="col-1">Constitution</td><td class="col-3">Stamina and health</td><td class="col-8">Endure a marathon, grasp hot metal without flinching, win a drinking contest</td></tr><tr><td class="col-1">Intelligence</td><td class="col-3">Memory and reason</td><td class="col-8">Recall a bit of lore, recognize a clue's significance, decode an encrypted message</td></tr><tr><td class="col-1">Wisdom</td><td class="col-3">Perceptiveness and willpower</td><td class="col-8">Spot a hidden creature, sense that someone is lying</td></tr><tr><td class="col-1">Charisma</td><td class="col-3">Social influence and confidence</td><td class="col-8">Persuade a creature to do something, cow a crowd, lie to someone convincingly</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="790" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Contests</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p238</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 contest is a kind of ability check that matches two creatures against

directly foils or is directly opposed by another creature's efforts. In a
 contest, the ability checks are compared to each other, rather than to a
 target number.</p><p>When you call for a contest, you pick the ability 
that each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the same 
ability or whether different abilities should counter each other. For 
example, when a creature tries to hide, it engages in a contest of 
Dexterity against Wisdom. But if two creatures arm wrestle, or if one 
creature is holding a door closed against another's attempt to push it 
open, both use Strength.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="791" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Intelligence Check vs. Wisdom Check</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p238</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>If

 numbers associated with these categories of difficulty are meant to be 
easy to keep in your head, so that you don't have to refer to this book 
every time you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC 
categories at the gaming table.</p><p>If you've decided that an ability 
check is called for, then most likely the task at hand isn't a very easy
 one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with little chance of 
failure. Unless circumstances are unusual, let characters succeed at 
such a task without making a check.</p><p>Then ask yourself, "Is this 
task's difficulty easy, moderate, or hard?" If the only DCs you ever use
 are 10, 15, and 20, your game will run just fine. Keep in mind that a 
character with a 10 in the associated ability and no proficiency will 
succeed at an easy task around 50 percent of the time. A moderate task 
requires a higher score or proficiency for success, whereas a hard task 
typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;d20&quot;}">d20</span> also doesn't hurt.</p><p>If
 you find yourself thinking, "This task is especially hard," you can use
 a higher DC, but do so with caution and consider the level of the 
characters. A DC 25 task is very hard for low-level characters to 
accomplish, but it becomes more reasonable after 10th level or so. A DC 
30 check is nearly impossible for most low-level characters. A 
20th-level character with proficiency and a relevant ability score of 20
 still needs a 19 or 20 on the die roll to succeed at a task of this 
difficulty.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="797" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Variant: Automatic Success</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p239</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Sometimes the randomness of a <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 roll leads to ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a DC 15 
Strength check to batter down. A fighter with Strength 20 might 
helplessly flail against the door due to bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the 
rogue with a 10 Strength rolls a natural 20 on her first check and 
knocks the door from its hinges.</p><p>If such results bother you, allow
 automatic success on checks for characters with high ability scores. 
Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any 
ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score
 minus 5. So in the above example, the fighter would automatically kick 
in the door. This rule doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or 
attack rolls.</p><p>The downside of this approach is its predictability.
 Once a character's ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower 
using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then 
always try to match the character with the highest ability score against
 any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set 
higher DCs. Doing this, though, can merely aggravate the problem you're 
trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even
 more on luck.</p><p>You can modify this rule to account for 
proficiencies using an additional option. If a character can apply a 
proficiency bonus to the check, he or she automatically succeeds if its 
DC is less than or equal to the relevant ability score. If you don't 
mind predictability, and you can resist the temptation to increase DCs, 
you might find that this variant speeds up play and focuses attention on
 truly difficult, tense situations.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="798" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Proficiency</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p239</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When
 you ask a player to make an ability check, consider whether a skill or

 if a particular proficiency applies.</p><p>One way to think about this 
is to consider whether a character could become better at a particular 
task through training and practice. If the answer is no, it's fine to 
say that no proficiency applies. But if the answer is yes, then find an 
appropriate skill or tool proficiency to reflect that training and 
practice.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="799" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Skills</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p239</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As
 described in the Player's Handbook, a skill proficiency represents a 
character's focus on one aspect of an ability. Among all the things a 
character's Dexterity score describes, the character might be 
particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in proficiency in the
 Stealth skill. When that skill is used for an ability check, it is 
usually used with Dexterity.</p><p>Under certain circumstances, you can 
decide a character's proficiency in a skill can be applied to a 
different ability check. For example, you might decide that a character 
forced to swim from an island to the mainland must succeed on a 
Constitution check (as opposed to a Strength check) because of the 
distance involved. The character is proficient in the Athletics skill, 
which covers swimming, so you allow the character's proficiency bonus to
 apply to this ability check. In effect, you're asking for a 
Constitution (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="athletics_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Athletics</span>) check, instead of a Strength (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="athletics_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Athletics</span>) check.</p><p>Often,
 players ask whether they can apply a skill proficiency to an ability

character's training and aptitude in a skill should apply to the check, 
go ahead and allow it, rewarding the player's creative thinking.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="800" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tools</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p239</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Having
 proficiency with a tool allows you to apply your proficiency bonus to

 and disadvantage are among the most useful tools in your DM's toolbox. 
They reflect temporary circumstances that might affect the chances of a 
character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage is also a great way
 to reward a player who shows exceptional creativity in play.</p><p>Characters
 often gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special 
abilities, actions, spells, or other features of their classes or 
backgrounds. In other cases, you decide whether a circumstance 
influences a roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage 
or impose disadvantage as a result.</p><p>Consider granting <b>advantage</b> when...</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Circumstances not related to a creature's inherent capabilities provide it with an edge.</li><li class="rd__li ">Some aspect of the environment contributes to the character's chance of success.</li><li class="rd__li ">A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in attempting or describing a task.</li><li class="rd__li ">Previous actions (whether taken by the character making the attempt or some other creature) improve the chances of success.</li></ul><p>Consider imposing <b>disadvantage</b> when...</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Circumstances hinder success in some way.</li><li class="rd__li ">Some

 advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, there's no need to 
keep track of how many circumstances weigh on both sides.</p><p>For 
example, imagine a wizard is running down a dungeon corridor to escape 
from a beholder. Around the corner ahead, two ogres lie in wait. Does 
the wizard hear the ogres readying their ambush? You look at the

 wizard is running, not paying attention to what's ahead of him. This 
imposes disadvantage on the wizard's ability check. However, the ogres 
are readying a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, 
which could grant the wizard advantage on the check. As a result, the 
character has neither advantage nor disadvantage on the Wisdom check, 
and you don't need to consider any additional factors. Past encounters 
with an ogre ambush, the fact that the wizard's ears are still ringing 
from the thunderwave spell he cast at the beholder, the overall noise 
level of the dungeon-none of that matters any more.

 inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and 
risk-taking. As explained in the Player's Handbook, having inspiration 
gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on 
one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a 
character can have no more than one inspiration at a time.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="804" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Awarding Inspiration</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p240</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Think
 of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your campaign. 
Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part 
of the game. If you take away anything from this section, remember this 
golden rule: inspiration should make the game more enjoyable for 
everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that make the game
 more exciting, amusing, or memorable.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, aim to 
award inspiration to each character about once per session of play. Over
 time, you might want to award inspiration more or less often, at a rate
 that works best for your table. You might use the same rate for your 
entire DMing career, or you might change it with each campaign.</p><p>Offering
 inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior in your 
players. Think of your style as a DM and your group's preferences. What 
helps make the game more fun for your group? What type of actions fit in
 with your campaign's style or genre? Your answers to those questions 
help determine when you award inspiration.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="805" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Roleplaying.</span></span> <p>Using
 inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most 
groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or 
her character to do something that is consistent with the character's 
personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character's action should be 
notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the 
adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In 
essence, you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the 
game more enjoyable for everyone else.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Take
 into account each player's roleplaying style, and try not to favor one 
style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking 
in an accent and adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels 
self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his 
character's attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the 
other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good 
effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="806" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Heroism.</span></span> <p>You
 can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A 
fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the 
midst of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character's 
daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that 
you want them to embrace swashbuckling action.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>This
 approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. 
For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;d20&quot;}">d20</span>
 roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a 
cushion against failure-and a guarantee that it comes into play only 
when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes 
risky tactics less daunting.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="807" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">A Reward for Victory.</span></span> <p>Some
 DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration 
normally requires a DM's judgment to award, which might run against your
 style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most 
outcomes. If that's your style, consider using inspiration as a reward 
when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a
 surge of confidence and energy.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Under
 this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters 
manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a 
goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the campaign.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="808" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Genre Emulation.</span></span> <p>Inspiration
 is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. 
Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality 
traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For 
example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an 
additional flaw:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>"I can't 
resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she 
is nothing but trouble." If the characters agree to help a suspicious 
but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue 
and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.</p><p>Similarly, characters 
in a horror story typically can't help but spend a night in a haunted 
house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they 
shouldn't. If the party splits up, consider giving each character 
inspiration.</p><p>A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues 
and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we're not dealing 
with sensible people; we're dealing with protagonists in a particular 
type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre's 
main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign 
begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for 
embracing those conventions.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="809" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Players and Inspiration.</span></span> <p>Remember
 that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some 
groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding 
collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's best to let players award 
their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about 
following certain guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce
 conventions of a certain genre.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="810" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">When Do You Award Inspiration?</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p241</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Consider
 the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award 
inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage 
specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering 
options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Waiting
 until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means 
players don't know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. 
It also means the player can't spend the inspiration on the act that 
earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are 
quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for 
groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM 
steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they want.</p><p>Telling
 a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it 
can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices
 for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups
 that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group 
storytelling, where character freedom isn't as important as weaving a 
compelling tale together.</p><p>Start with awarding inspiration after an
 action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new 
group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and 
avoids making the players feel as if you are being manipulative.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="811" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tracking Inspiration</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p241</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A

 might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of 
metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other 
parts of the game are their own rewards that don't need incentives like 
inspiration.</p><p>If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling 
the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where 
they may. It's a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM

 a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose 
track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can 
allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every 
session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player 
follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding 
inspiration.</p><p>This approach makes your life easier and also gives 
players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need
 to make sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.</p><p>This 
approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls 
flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key 
situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or 
whatever other criteria the group has established.</p><p>In this 
variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once 
per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards 
inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later 
in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give 
advantage to any foe of the player characters. There's no limit to the 
number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration
 carries over from one session to the next.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="814" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Resolution and Consequences</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p242</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You

 can be tough, but the agony is compounded when a character fails by the
 barest margin. When a character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can 
allow the character to succeed at the cost of a complication or 
hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the following lines:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">A
 character manages to get her sword past a hobgoblin's defenses and turn
 a near miss into a hit, but the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms
 her.</li><li class="rd__li ">A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a fireball but ends up prone.</li><li class="rd__li ">A

finish an arduous climb to the top of a cliff despite slipping, only to 
realize that the rope on which his companions dangle below him is close 
to breaking.</li></ul><p>When you introduce costs such as these, try to 
make them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature of the 
adventuring situation. In exchange for success, players must consider 
new ways of facing the challenge.</p><p>You can also use this technique

 a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw doesn't normally have
 any special effect. However, you can choose to take such an exceptional
 roll into account when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you to

 environment the adventurers are exploring, you can use a map to follow 
their progress as you relate the details of their travels. In a dungeon,
 tracking movement on a map lets you describe the branching passages, 
doors, chambers, and other features the adventurers encounter as they 
go, and gives the players the opportunity to choose their own path. 
Similarly, a wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and other 
features that might guide the characters on their travels-or lead them 
astray.</p><p>The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on maps 
of different scales. The table shows how much distance on a map the 
adventurers can cover on foot in minutes, hours, or days. The table uses
 the travel paces-slow, normal, and fast-described in the Player's 
Handbook. Characters moving at a normal pace can walk about 24 miles in a
 day.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="820">Map Travel Pace</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Map Scale</th><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Slow Pace</th><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Normal Pace</th><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Fast Pace</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-3">Dungeon (1 sq. = 10 ft.)</td><td class="col-3">20 sq./min.</td><td class="col-3">30 sq./min.</td><td class="col-3">40 sq./min.</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">City (1 sq. = 100 ft.)</td><td class="col-3">2 sq./min.</td><td class="col-3">3 sq./min.</td><td class="col-3">4 sq./min.</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Province (1 hex = 1 mi.)</td><td class="col-3">2 hexes/hr., 18 hexes/day</td><td class="col-3">3 hexes/hr., 24 hexes/day</td><td class="col-3">4 hexes/hr., 30 hexes/day</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Kingdom (1 hex = 6 mi.)</td><td class="col-3">1 hex/3 hr., 3 hexes/day</td><td class="col-3">1 hex/2 hr., 4 hexes/day</td><td class="col-3">1 hex/1½ hr., 5 hexes/day</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="821" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Special Travel Pace</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p242</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 rules on travel pace in the Player's Handbook assume that a group of 
travelers adopts a pace that, over time, is unaffected by the individual
 members' walking speeds. The difference between walking speeds can be 
significant during combat, but during an overland journey, the 
difference vanishes as travelers pause to catch their breath, the faster
 ones wait for the slower ones, and one traveler's quickness is matched 
by another traveler's endurance.</p><p>A character bestride a phantom 
steed, soaring through the air on a carpet of flying, or riding a 
sailboat or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel at a 
normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind doesn't tire the way a 
creature does and the air doesn't contain the types of obstructions 
found on land. When a creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a
 speed granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as wind or a
 water current), translate that speed into travel rates using the 
following rules:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to your speed times 10.</li><li class="rd__li ">In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to your speed divided by 10.</li><li class="rd__li ">For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by the number of hours traveled (typically 8 hours).</li><li class="rd__li ">For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third.</li><li class="rd__li ">For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds.</li></ul><p>For
 example, a character under the effect of a wind walk spell gains a 
flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, the character can move 3,000 feet
 at a normal pace, 4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow 
pace.</p><p>The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an hour.
 The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character to travel 160, 240,
 or 320 miles in a day.</p><p>Similarly, a phantom steed spell creates a
 magical mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn't tire like a real 
horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover 1,000 feet in 1 minute 
at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace.
 In 1 hour, the character can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="822" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Visibility Outdoors</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p243</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When

 DC for the check depends on how well the ground shows signs of a 
creature's passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks 
are obvious. For example, no check is needed to track an army advancing 
along a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is more 
challenging, unless the creature being tracked leaves a distinct trail. 
Additionally, the passage of time often makes tracks harder to follow. 
In a situation where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that 
tracking is impossible. The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for 
setting the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your 
assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant advantage on the check 
if there's more than one set of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the
 trail being followed passes through a well-trafficked area.</p><p>On a 
failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to find it 
again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10 minutes to 
find a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="825">Tracking DCs</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-10" data-rd-isroller="false">Ground Surface</th><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-10">Soft surface such as snow</td><td class="col-2 text-center">10</td></tr><tr><td class="col-10">Dirt or grass</td><td class="col-2 text-center">15</td></tr><tr><td class="col-10">Bare stone</td><td class="col-2 text-center">20</td></tr><tr><td class="col-10">Each day since the creature passed</td><td class="col-2 text-center">+5</td></tr><tr><td class="col-10">Creature left a trail such as blood</td><td class="col-2 text-center">-5</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="826" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Social Interaction</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p244</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>During

 creature wants to help the adventurers and wishes for them to succeed. 
For tasks or actions that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, 
friendly creatures usually help without question. If an element of 
personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check might be required
 to convince a friendly creature to take that risk.</p><p>An <b>indifferent</b>
 creature might help or hinder the party, depending on what the creature
 sees as most beneficial. A creature's indifference doesn't necessarily 
make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent creatures might be 
polite and genial, surly and irritable, or anything in between. A 
successful Charisma check is necessary when the adventurers try to 
persuade an indifferent creature to do something.</p><p>A <b>hostile</b>
 creature opposes the adventurers and their goals but doesn't 
necessarily attack them on sight. For example, a condescending noble 
might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep them
 from becoming rivals for the king's attention, thwarting them with 
slander and scheming rather than direct threats and violence. The 
adventurers need to succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks 
to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf. That 
said, a hostile creature might be so ill-disposed toward the party that 
no Charisma check can improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to
 sway it through diplomacy fails automatically.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="829" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">2.

 some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn't come naturally for
 you, don't worry. The main thing is for you to have fun portraying your
 NPCs and monsters and to amuse your players in the process. You don't 
need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create drama or humor. 
The key is to pay attention to the story elements and characterizations 
that make your players laugh or feel emotionally engaged and to 
incorporate those things into your roleplaying.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="838" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Being the NPC</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p245</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Imagine
 how a character or monster you bring to life would react to the 
adventurers. Consider what it cares about. Does it have any ideals, 
flaws, or bonds? By working such things into your portrayal, you not 
only make the character or monster more believable, but you also enhance
 the sense that the adventurers are in a living world.</p><p>Strive for 
responses and actions that introduce twists into the game. For example, 
an old woman whose family was killed at the hands of an evil wizard 
might regard the party's wizard with grave suspicion.</p><p>However you 
roleplay a character or monster, the classic advice for writers holds 
true: show, don't tell. For example, rather than describe an NPC as 
shallow and self-centered, have the individual act the way you would 
expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The NPC might have 
off-the-cuff answers for everything, an over-willingness to share 
personal anecdotes, and a desperate need to make himself or herself the 
subject of every conversation.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="839" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Using Your Voice</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p245</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Most
 of what you say during a session will be at a consistent level. For 
dramatic effect, be ready to shout out a battle cry or speak in a 
conspiratorial whisper.</p><p>Also, characters and monsters with 
distinctive voices are memorable. If you're not a natural mimic or 
actor, borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the movies,
 or television is a good place to start. Practice different voices and 
impersonations of famous people, then use those voices to bring your 
NPCs to life.</p><p>Experiment with different speech patterns. For 
instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use their words 
differently. Similarly, peasants could speak in earthy dialects, while 
rich folk talk in haughty drawls.</p><p>Let a pirate NPC say, "Arrrr, 
maties!" in your best Long John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters 
unfamiliar with Common stumble along with awkward grammar.</p><p>Let 
drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred speech, while lizardfolk hiss
 their threats. In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure the 
adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk to them, not so much to
 each other. If possible, let one NPC do most of the talking, but if 
multiple NPCs need to talk, give them distinct voices so the players 
know who's who.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="840" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Using Your Face and Arms</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p246</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Use

inspire players to make just as much investment in portraying their 
characters. This makes social interactions an opportunity for everyone 
to become more immersed in the game, creating a story whose protagonists
 have depth.</p><p>To make sure everyone has something to do during a 
roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of the following 
approaches.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="842" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Appeal to Player Preferences.</span></span> <p>There
 are in-game activities that players enjoy more than others, as 
discussed in this book's introduction. Players who like acting thrive in
 interaction situations, and it's fine to let those players take the 
spotlight. They often inspire other players by their example, but make 
sure those other players have an opportunity to join in the fun.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Players
 who like exploring and storytelling are usually amenable to 
roleplaying, as long as it moves the campaign forward and reveals more 
about the world. Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring 
out the right thing to say to shift an NPC's attitude. Players who are 
instigators like provoking reactions from NPCs, so they're often easily 
engaged-though not always productively.</p><p>Players who like to 
optimize their characters and slay monsters also like to argue, and 
having conflict within an interaction can help those players embrace 
roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an extended 
interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending assassins to kill the 
adventurers) is often the best way to keep action-focused players 
engaged.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="843" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Target Specific Characters.</span></span> <p>Create
 situations where characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a 
social interaction have to do at least some of the talking. Perhaps the 
NPC in question is a family member or a contact of a particular 
adventurer and talks only to that character. An NPC of a certain race or
 class might listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. 
Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to get specific 
players engaged, but don't shut out players who are already roleplaying.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>If
 a couple of players are dominating the conversation, take a moment now 
and then to involve the others. You can do this in character if you 
like: "And what about your hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will 
you pledge in exchange for my favor?" Or just ask the player what his or
 her character is doing while the conversation is going on. The first 
approach is better for players who are already comfortable speaking in 
their characters' voices. The second approach works better for players 
who need encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario.</p></div></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="844" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Objects</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p246</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When

object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the 
object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If 
you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller 
sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one
 of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a 
Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large 
legs is reduced to 0 hit points.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="851" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Objects and Damage Types</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p247</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Objects

 than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing

 DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players can't see: usually a
 piece of paper behind a DM screen or a spreadsheet on a tablet 
computer. This method allows you to keep track of combatants who haven't
 been revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place to 
record the current hit points of monsters, as well as other useful 
notes.</p><p>A downside of this approach is that you have to remind the players round after round when their turns come up.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="856" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Visible List</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p247</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You
 can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the players tell you their
 initiative numbers, write them on the whiteboard in order from highest 
to lowest, leaving space between each name. Either write the monsters' 
initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the list on each
 monster's first turn.</p><p>As a further improvement, use magnets that 
you can attach to a metal-based whiteboard with characters' and 
monsters' names written on them, or write those names on cards held in 
place by magnets.</p><p>A visible list lets everyone see the order of 
play. Players know when their turns are coming up, and they can start 
planning their actions in advance. A visible list also removes any 
uncertainty about when the monsters will act in the fight.</p><p>A 
variation on the visible list is to give one player responsibility for 
keeping track of initiative, either on a whiteboard or on a piece of 
paper the other players can see. This method reduces the number of 
things you need to keep track of yourself.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="857" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Index Cards</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p247</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>In
 this approach, each character gets an index card, as does each group of
 identical monsters. When the players tell you their initiative numbers,
 write the numbers on their characters' index cards. Do the same when 
you roll the monsters' initiative. Then arrange the cards in order from 
highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move down through the stack.
 When you call out the name of the character whose turn it is, also 
mention who's next, prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After
 each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is moved to the 
bottom of the stack.</p><p>At first, players don't know the order of 
play when you use combat cards, and they don't know where the monsters 
fall into the order until the monsters act.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="858" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tracking Monster Hit Points</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p247</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>During
 a combat encounter, you need to track how much damage each monster 
takes. Most DMs track damage in secret so that their players don't know 
how many hit points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to be 
secretive or not is up to you. What's important is that every monster's 
hit points be tracked individually.</p><p>Tracking damage for one or two
 monsters isn't onerous, but it helps to have a system for larger groups
 of monsters. If you aren't using miniatures or other visual aids, the 
easiest way to keep track of your monsters is to assign them unique 
features.</p><p>Descriptions such as "the ogre with the nasty scar" and 
"the ogre with the horned helm" help you and your players track which 
monster is which. For example, imagine that you're running an encounter 
with three ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative is 
rolled, jot down each ogre's hit points and add notes (and even a name, 
if you like) to differentiate each one:</p><ul class="rd__list rd__list-no-bullets"><li class="rd__li ">Krag (<a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ogre_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="ogre_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">ogre</a> w/ scar): 59</li><li class="rd__li ">Thod (<a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ogre_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="ogre_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">ogre</a> w/ helm): 59</li><li class="rd__li ">Mur (<a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ogre_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="ogre_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">ogre</a> who smells like poo): 59</li></ul><p>If
 you use miniatures to represent monsters, one easy way to differentiate
 them is to give each one a unique miniature. If you use identical 
miniatures to represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures 
with small stickers of different colors or stickers with different 
letters or numbers on them.</p><p>For example, in a combat encounter 
with three ogres, you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged 
with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track the ogres' hit 
points, you can sort them by letter, then subtract damage from their hit
 points as they take it.</p><p>Your records might look something like this after a few rounds of combat:</p><ul class="rd__list rd__list-no-bullets"><li class="rd__li ">Ogre A: <s>59</s> <s>53</s> <s>45</s> <s>24</s> <s>14</s> <s>9</s> dead</li><li class="rd__li ">Ogre B: <s>59</s> <s>51</s> 30</li><li class="rd__li ">Ogre C: 59</li></ul><p>Players
 often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don't ever feel as though you need 
to reveal exact hit points, but if a monster is below half its hit point
 maximum, it's fair to say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten
 down.</p><p>You can describe a monster taken to half its hit points as 
bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight against a 
tough opponent, and helping them judge when to use their most powerful 
spells and abilities.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="859" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Using and Tracking Conditions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p248</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Various
 rules and features in the game are clear about when they apply a 
condition to a creature. You can also apply conditions on the fly. 
They're meant to be intuitive for you to do so. For example, if a 
character is in a state, such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you 
can say the character is <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="unconscious_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">unconscious</a>. Or did a character just stumble onto the ground? He or she is now <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="prone_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">prone</a>.</p><p>Keeping
 track of conditions can become tricky. For monsters, it's often easiest
 to track conditions on combat cards or wherever you track initiative. 
Players should remember any conditions affecting their characters. 
Because players have incentive to forget or overlook hampering 
conditions, character conditions can also be marked on combat cards or a
 whiteboard.</p><p>You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on
 hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then hand the cards to 
players as the conditions come up. Having a bright pink index card on 
top of a character sheet can help even the most absentminded player 
remember the effects of being <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#charmed_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="charmed_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">charmed</a> or <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#frightened_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="frightened_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">frightened</a>.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="860" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Monsters and Critical Hits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p248</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 monster follows the same rule for critical hits as a player character. 
That said, if you use a monster's average damage, rather than rolling, 
you might wonder how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores a
 critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with the hit and add 
them to the average damage. For example, if a goblin normally deals 5 (<span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 example, if a wizard directs burning hands (a 15-foot cone) at a nearby

launch a lightning bolt (100-foot line) at some ogres and hobgoblins, 
and you could use the table to say four of the monsters are targeted 
(100 ÷ 30 = 3.33, rounded up to 4).</p><p>This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial precision.

 combat moving along at a brisk pace can be difficult when there are 
dozens of monsters involved in a battle. When handling a crowded 
battlefield, you can speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of 
approximating the average number of hits a large group of monsters can 
inflict on a target.</p><p>Instead of rolling an attack roll, determine the minimum <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 roll a creature needs in order to hit a target by subtracting its 
attack bonus from the target's AC. You'll need to refer to the result 
throughout the battle, so it's best to write it down.</p><p>Look up the minimum <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 roll needed on the Mob Attacks table. The table shows you how many 
creatures that need that die roll or higher must attack a target in 
order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures attack the target, 
their combined efforts result in one of them hitting the target.</p><p>For
 example, eight orcs surround a fighter. The orcs' attack bonus is +5, 
and the fighter's AC is 19. The orcs need a 14 or higher to hit the 
fighter. According to the table, for every three orcs that attack the 
fighter, one of them hits. There are enough orcs for two groups of 
three. The remaining two orcs fail to hit the fighter.</p><p>If the 
attacking creatures deal different amounts of damage, assume that the 
creature that deals the most damage is the one that hits. If the 
creature that hits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus, 
assume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a creature's 
attacks have different attack bonuses, resolve each attack separately.</p><p>This
 attack resolution system ignores critical hits in favor of reducing the
 number of die rolls. As the number of combatants dwindles, switch back 
to using individual die rolls to avoid situations where one side can't 
possibly hit the other.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="867">Mob Attacks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-6 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">d20 Roll Needed</th><th class="col-6 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">Attackers Needed for One to Hit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">1-5</td><td class="col-6 text-center">1</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">6-12</td><td class="col-6 text-center">2</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">13-14</td><td class="col-6 text-center">3</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">15-16</td><td class="col-6 text-center">4</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">17-18</td><td class="col-6 text-center">5</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">19-19</td><td class="col-6 text-center">10</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6 text-center">20-20</td><td class="col-6 text-center">20</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="868" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Using Miniatures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p250</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 combat, players can often rely on your descriptions to visualize where 
their characters are in relation to their surroundings and their 
enemies. Some complex battles, however, are easier to run with visual 
aids, the most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If you like to
 construct model terrain, build three-dimensional dungeons, or draw maps
 on large vinyl mats, you should also consider using miniatures.</p><p>The <i>Player's Handbook</i> offers simple rules for depicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. This section expands on that material.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="869" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tactical Maps</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p250</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You
 can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a wet-erase vinyl mat 
with 1-inch squares, on a large sheet of paper, or on a similar flat 
surface. Preprinted poster-sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard 
tiles, and terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fun.</p><p>The
 most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foot square, and maps with 
grids are readily available and easy to create. However, you don't have 
to use a grid at all. You can track distances with a tape measure, 
string, craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. Another 
option is a play surface covered by 1-inch hexagons (often called 
hexes), which combines the easy counting of a grid with the more 
flexible movement of using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight 
walls and right angles don't map easily onto hexes, though.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="870" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creature Size on Squares and Hexes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p251</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 creature's size determines how much space it occupies on squares or 
hexes, as shown in the Creature Size and Space table. If the miniature 
you use for a monster takes up an amount of space different from what's 
on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster as its official size 
for all other rules. For example, you might use a miniature that has a 
Large base to represent a Huge giant. The giant takes up less space on 
the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still Huge for the 
purposes of rules like grappling.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="871">Creature Size and Space</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Size</th><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Space: Squares</th><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Space: Hexes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-3">Tiny</td><td class="col-6">4 per square</td><td class="col-3">4 per hex</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Small</td><td class="col-6">1 square</td><td class="col-3">1 hex</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Medium</td><td class="col-6">1 square</td><td class="col-3">1 hex</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Large</td><td class="col-6">4 squares (2 by 2)</td><td class="col-3">3 hexes</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Huge</td><td class="col-6">9 squares (3 by 3)</td><td class="col-3">7 hexes</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Gargantuan</td><td class="col-6">16 squares (4 by 4) or more</td><td class="col-3">12 hexes or more</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 presents a simple method for counting movement and measuring range on a
 grid: count every square as 5 feet, even if you're moving diagonally. 
Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws of geometry and is 
inaccurate over long distances. This optional rule provides more 
realism, but it requires more effort during combat.</p><p>When measuring
 range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first diagonal square counts 
as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This 
pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're counting 
diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between 
different bits of diagonal movement.</p><p>For example, a character 
might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight 
(15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total 
movement of 30 feet.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="879" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Optional Rule: Facing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p252</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>If
 you want the precision of knowing which way a creature is facing, 
consider using this optional rule. Whenever a creature ends its move, it
 can change its facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it 
faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also 
change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.</p><p>A 
creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. 
It can't see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature's
 rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.</p><p>Shields 
apply their bonus to AC only against attacks from the front arc or the 
same side arc as the shield. For example, a fighter with a shield on the
 left arm can use it only against attacks from the front and left arcs.</p><p>Feel
 free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For 
example, an amorphous ochre jelly could treat all of its arcs as front 
ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. On 
squares, you pick one side of a creature's space as the direction it is 
facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to 
determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space 
determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either 
side of the creature form its side arcs.</p><p>On hexes, determining the
 front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the
 creature's space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for 
the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the 
rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its 
side arcs.</p><p>A square or hex might be in more than one arc, 
depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's space. If more 
than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it 
is split exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in 
the front arc, it's in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the 
rear arc, it's in the side arc.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="880" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adjudicating Reaction Timing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p252</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Typical
 combatants rely on the opportunity attack and the Ready action for most
 of their reactions in a fight. Various spells and features give a 
creature more reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reaction 
can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: follow whatever 
timing is specified in the reaction's description. For example, the 
opportunity attack and the shield spell are clear about the fact that 
they can interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing 
specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs after its 
trigger finishes, as in the Ready action.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="881" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Combining Game Effects</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p252</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Different
 game features can affect a target at the same time. But when two or 
more game features have the same name, only the effects of one of 
them-the most potent one-apply while the durations of the effects 
overlap. For example, if a target is ignited by a fire elemental's <i>Fire Form</i>
 trait, the ongoing fire damage doesn't increase if the burning target 
is subjected to that trait again. Game features include spells, class 
features, feats, racial traits, monster abilities, and magic items. See 
the related rule in the 'Combining Magical Effects' section of chapter 
10 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="882" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chases</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p252</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Strict application of the movement rules can turn a potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair.</p><p>Faster

 being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces 
pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to

 you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take the time to draw a

especially ones that require the characters to make ability checks or 
saving throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random table of 
complications similar to the ones in this section. Otherwise, improvise 
as you play.</p><p>Complications can be barriers to progress or 
opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased through a forest by 
bugbears might spot a wasp nest and slow down long enough to attack the 
nest or throw rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers.</p><p>A
 map of a chase can be linear or have many branches, depending on the 
nature of the chase. For example, a mine cart chase might have few (if 
any) branches, while a sewer chase might have several.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="895" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Role Reversal</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p255</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>During
 a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For

unwanted attention from other members of the thieves' guild. As they 
pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves pursuing 
them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases 
simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing thief might run into 
the waiting arms of his accomplices. The outnumbered characters might 
decide to flee with the thieves in pursuit.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="896" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Siege Equipment</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p255</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Siege

 points (XP) fuel level advancement for player characters and are most 
often the reward for completing combat encounters.</p><p>Each monster 
has an XP value based on its challenge rating. When adventurers defeat 
one or more monsters-typically by killing, routing, or capturing 
them-they divide the total XP value of the monsters evenly among 
themselves. If the party received substantial assistance from one or 
more NPCs, count those NPCs as party members when dividing up the XP. 
(Because the NPCs made the fight easier, individual characters receive 
fewer XP.)</p><p>Chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," provides guidelines for designing combat encounters using experience points.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="916" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Absent Characters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p260</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Typically,
 adventurers earn experience only for encounters they participate in. If
 a player is absent for a session, the player's character misses out on 
the experience points.</p><p>Over time, you might end up with a level 
gap between the characters of players who never miss a session and 
characters belonging to players who are more sporadic in their 
attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap of two or three levels 
between different characters in the same party isn't going to ruin the 
game for anyone.</p><p>Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating 
in the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is good incentive
 for players to attend as many sessions as possible.</p><p>As an 
alternative, give absent characters the same XP that the other 
characters earned each session, keeping the group at the same level. Few
 players will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just because 
they know they'll receive XP for it even if they don't show up.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="917" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Noncombat Challenges</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p261</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You
 decide whether to award experience to characters for overcoming 
challenges outside combat. If the adventurers complete a tense 
negotiation with a baron, forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly 
dwarves, or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might decide 
that they deserve an XP reward.</p><p>As a starting point, use the rules
 for building combat encounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of 
the challenge. Then award the characters XP as if it had been a combat 
encounter of the same difficulty, but only if the encounter involved a 
meaningful risk of failure.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="918" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Milestones</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p261</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You
 can also award XP when characters complete significant milestones. When
 preparing your adventure, designate certain events or challenges as 
milestones, as with the following examples:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to complete the adventure.</li><li class="rd__li ">Discovering a hidden location or piece of information relevant to the adventure.</li><li class="rd__li ">Reaching an important destination.</li></ul><p>When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter.</p><p>If
 you want to reward your players for their progress through an adventure
 with something more than XPand treasure, give them additional small 
rewards at milestone points. Here are some examples:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest.</li><li class="rd__li ">Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level spell slot.</li><li class="rd__li ">Characters can regain the use of magic items that have had their limited uses expended.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="919" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Level Advancement without XP</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p261</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You
 can do away with experience points entirely and control the rate of

they play, or when they accomplish significant story goals in the 
campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their characters

 good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach 2nd

 the Dungeon Master, you aren't limited by the rules in the Player's 
Handbook, the guidelines in this book, or the selection of monsters in 
the Monster Manual. You can let your imagination run wild. This chapter 
contains optional rules that you can use to customize your campaign, as 
well as guidelines on creating your own material, such as monsters and 
magic items.</p><p>The options in this chapter relate to many different 
parts of the game. Some of them are variants of rules, and others are 
entirely new rules. Each option represents a different genre, style of 
play, or both. Consider trying no more than one or two of the options at
 a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on your campaign 
before adding other options.</p><p>Before you add a new rule to your campaign, ask yourself two questions:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Will the rule improve the game?</li><li class="rd__li ">Will my players like it?</li></ul><p>If
 you're confident that the answer to both questions is yes, then you 
have nothing to lose by giving it a try. Urge your players to provide 
feedback. If the rule or game element isn't functioning as intended or 
isn't adding much to your game, you can refine it or ditch it. No matter
 what a rule's source, a rule serves you, not the other way around.</p><p>Beware
 of adding anything to your game that allows a character to concentrate 
on more than one effect at a time, use more than one reaction or bonus 
action per round, or attune to more than three magic items at a time. 
Rules and game elements that override the rules for concentration, 
reactions, bonus actions, and magic item attunement can seriously 
unbalance or overcomplicate your game.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="923" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ability Options</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p263</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The optional rules in this section pertain to using ability scores.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="924" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Proficiency Dice</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p263</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>This
 optional rule replaces a character's proficiency bonus with a 
proficiency die, adding more randomness to the game and making 
proficiency a less reliable indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a 
proficiency bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, 
the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die table shows 
which die or dice to roll, as determined by the character's level.</p><p>Whenever
 a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, lets a character double his 
or her proficiency bonus, the player rolls the character's proficiency 
die twice instead of once.</p><p>This option is intended for player characters and nonplayer characters who have levels, as opposed to monsters who don't.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="925">Proficiency Dice</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 no-wrap text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">Level</th><th class="col-5 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">Proficiency Bonus</th><th class="col-5 text-center" data-rd-isroller="false">Proficiency Die</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-2 no-wrap text-center">1st-4th</td><td class="col-5 text-center">+2</td><td class="col-5 text-center"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 skill dictates the circumstances under which a character can add his or

 Expertise feature works differently than normal under this rule. At 1st
 level, instead of choosing two skill proficiencies, a character with 
the Expertise class feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or 
she has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two of the 
character's Expertise choices. If the character would gain an additional
 skill proficiency, that character instead selects another ability check
 in which to gain proficiency.</p><p>This option removes skills from the
 game and doesn't allow for much distinction among characters. For 
example, a character can't choose to emphasize persuasion or 
intimidation; he or she is equally adept at both.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="929" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Background Proficiency</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p264</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>With
 this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool proficiencies. 
Anything that would grant the character a skill or tool proficiency 
provides no benefit. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency
 bonus to any ability check to which the character's prior training and 
experience (reflected in the character's background) reasonably applies.
 The DM is the ultimate judge of whether the character's background 
applies.</p><p>For example, the player of a character with the noble 
background could reasonably argue that the proficiency bonus should 
apply to a Charisma check the character makes to secure an audience with
 the king. The player should be encouraged to explain in specific terms 
how the character's background applies. Not simply "I'm a noble," but "I
 spent three years before starting my adventuring career serving as my 
family's ambassador to the court, and this sort of thing is second 
nature to me now."</p><p>This simple system relies heavily on players 
developing their characters' histories. Don't let it result in endless 
debates about whether a character's proficiency bonus applies in a given
 situation. Unless a player's attempt to explain the relevance of the 
character's background makes everyone else at the table roll their eyes 
at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the player for making the effort.</p><p>If
 a character has the Expertise feature, instead of choosing skills and 
tools to gain the benefit of that feature, the player defines aspects of
 his or her background to which the benefit applies. Continuing the 
noble example, the player might decide to apply Expertise to "situations
 where courtly manners and etiquette are paramount" and "figuring out 
the secret plots that court members hatch against one another."</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="930" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Personality Trait Proficiency</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p264</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>With
 this variant rule, characters don't have skill proficiencies. Instead, a
 character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check 
directly related to the character's positive personality traits. For 
example, a character with a positive personality trait of "I never have a
 plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go along" might apply the 
bonus when engaging in some off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight
 spot. A player should come up with at least four positive personality 
traits when creating a character.</p><p>When a character's negative 
personality trait directly impacts an ability check, the character has 
disadvantage on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative trait is
 "I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, oblivious to my
 surroundings" might have disadvantage on an ability check made to 
notice creatures sneaking up.</p><p>If a character has the Expertise 
feature, the player can apply its benefit to personality traits related 
to ability checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would 
gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead gains a new 
positive personality trait.</p><p>This system relies heavily on players 
developing their characters' personalities. Make sure that different 
characters' traits—positive and negative—come into play with about the 
same frequency. Don't let a player get away with a positive trait that 
always seems to apply and a negative trait that never does.</p><p>At your discretion, you can also tie a character's ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="931" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Hero Points</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p264</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Hero
 points work well in epic fantasy and mythic campaigns in which the

loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total equal to 5 + half 
the character's level.</p><p>A player can spend a hero point whenever he
 or she makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw The 
player can spend the hero point after the roll is made but before any of
 its results are applied. Spending the hero point allows the player to

 your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code of honor is part of 
daily life, consider using the Honor score as a means of measuring a 
character's devotion to that code. This ability fits well in a setting 
inspired by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten Realms. 
The Honor ability is also useful in any campaign that revolves around 
orders of knights.</p><p>Honor measures not only a character's devotion 
to a code but also the character's understanding of it. The Honor score 
can also reflect how others perceive a character's honor. A character 
with a high Honor usually has a reputation that others know about, 
especially those who have high Honor scores themselves.</p><p>Unlike 
other abilities, Honor can't be raised with normal ability score 
increases. Instead, you can award increases to Honor—or impose 
reductions—based on a character's actions. At the end of an adventure, 
if you think a character's actions in the adventure reflected well or 
poorly on his or her understanding of the code, you can increase or 
decrease the character's Honor by 1. As with other ability scores, a 
character's Honor can't exceed 20 or fall below 1.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="934" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Honor Checks.</span></span> <p>Honor

During their downtime, characters can use the training rules in the 
Player's Handbook to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough
 ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="952" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Properties</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p267</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Firearms use special ammunition, and some of them have the burst fire or reload property.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="953" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ammunition.</span></span> <p>The

 can spend no more than 1 plot point per session. You can increase this 
limit if you like, especially if you want the players to drive more of 
the story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot point, they 
each gain 1 plot point.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="966" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Option 1: What a Twist!</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p269</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A

example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her 
character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns 
out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a horrid beast.</p><p>A 
player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute 
to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get 
feedback before settling on a plot development.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="967" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Option 2: The Plot Thickens</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p269</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Whenever
 a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a
 complication to the scene. For example, if the player who spends the

 trap that teleports the party to another part of the dungeon.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="968" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Option 3: The Gods Must Be Crazy</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p269</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>With
 this approach, there is no permanent DM. Everyone makes a character, 
and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That 
person's character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or 
remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.</p><p>At any time, a 
player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player's character 
becomes an NPC, and play continues. It's probably not a good idea to 
swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group 
allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up 
where the previous DM left off.</p><p>Using plot points in this way can 
make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in 
unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be 
DMs to try running a game in small, controlled doses.</p><p>In a 
campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the 
table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A 
player who isn't prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose to 
not spend a plot point that session.</p><p>For this approach to work, 
it's a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign
 so that DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each other's 
plans.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="969" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Combat Options</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p270</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 initiative for each PC and monster, arranging everyone in the correct

 Neither roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins 
initiative. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie is broken.</p><p>When
 it's a side's turn, the members of that side can act in any order they 
choose. Once everyone on the side has taken a turn, the other side goes.
 A round ends when both sides have completed their turns.</p><p>If more 
than two sides take part in a battle, each side rolls for initiative. 
Sides act from the highest roll to lowest. Combat continues in the 
initiative order until the battle is complete.</p><p>This variant 
encourages teamwork and makes your life as a DM easier, since you can

 DMs find the regular progression of initiative too predictable and 
prone to abuse. Players can use their knowledge of the initiative order 
to influence their decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might
 charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes before the monster
 and can heal him.</p><p>Speed factor is an option for initiative that 
introduces more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of play. 
Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll initiative each 
round. Before rolling, each character or monster must choose an action.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="974" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Initiative Modifiers.</span></span> <p>Modifiers
 might apply to a creature's initiative depending on its size and the 
action it takes. For example, a creature that fights with a light weapon
 or casts a simple spell is more likely to act before a creature armed 
with a heavy or slow weapon. See the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers 
table for details. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has 
no effect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies such as 
wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon, apply them all to the 
initiative roll.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="975">Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Factor</th><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Initiative Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-6">Spellcasting</td><td class="col-6">Subtract the spell's level</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Melee, heavy weapon</td><td class="col-6">-2</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Melee, light or finesse weapon</td><td class="col-6">+2</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Melee, two-handed weapon</td><td class="col-6">-2</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Ranged, loading weapon</td><td class="col-6">-5</td></tr></tbody></table><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><thead><tr><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Creature Size</th><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Initiative Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-6">Tiny</td><td class="col-6">+5</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Small</td><td class="col-6">+2</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Medium</td><td class="col-6">+0</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Large</td><td class="col-6">-2</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Huge</td><td class="col-6">-5</td></tr><tr><td class="col-6">Gargantuan</td><td class="col-6">-8</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Don't
 apply the same modifier more than once on a creature's turn. For 
example, a rogue fighting with two daggers gains the +2 bonus for using a
 light or finesse weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply 
only the modifier from the highest-level spell.</p><p>Apply any 
modifiers for bonus actions to that creature's turn, remembering never 
to apply the same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a 
2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a shortsword. 
The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell and gains a +2 bonus for 
using a light weapon, for a total modifier of +0.</p><p>The table is 
only a starting point. You can refer to it when adjudicating any actions
 a character takes that you think should be faster or slower. Quick, 
easy actions should grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should 
incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or penalty of 2 or 5 
for an action.</p><p>For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to 
raise a portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could rule

 you can start figuring out how to represent your monster in the game.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="987" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Modifying a Monster</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p273</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Once
 you have an idea for a monster, you'll need statistics to represent it.
 The first question you should ask yourself is: Can I use statistics 
that already exist?</p><p>A stat block in the Monster Manual might make a
 good starting point for your monster. Imagine, for example, that you 
want to create an intelligent arboreal predator that hunts elves. There 
is no such monster in the Monster Manual, but the quaggoth is a savage 
humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could borrow the quaggoth 
stat block for your new monster, changing nothing but the creature's 
name. You can also make minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth's 
language, Undercommon, with one that's more appropriate, such as Elvish 
or Sylvan.</p><p>Need a fiery phoenix? Take the giant eagle or roc, give
 it immunity to fire, and allow it to deal fire damage with its attacks.
 Need a flying monkey? Consider a baboon with wings and a flying speed. 
Almost any monster you can imagine can be built using one that already 
exists.</p><p>Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than 
creating one from scratch, and there are changes you can make to an 
existing monster that have no effect on its challenge rating, such as 
swapping languages, changing its alignment, or adding special senses. 
However, once you change the creature's offensive or defensive ability, 
such as its hit points or damage, its challenge rating might need to 
change, as shown later.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="988" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Switching Weapons</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p273</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>If
 a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can replace that weapon 
with a different one. For example, you could replace a hobgoblin's 
longsword with a halberd. Don't forget to change the damage and the 
attack's reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the consequences of 
switching from a one-handed weapon to a two-handed weapon, or vice 
versa. For example, a hobgoblin wielding a halberd (a two-handed weapon)
 loses the benefit of its shield, so its AC decreases by 2.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="989" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adding a Special Trait</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p274</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Another
 simple way to customize a monster is to add a special trait. You can 
add a special trait of your own devising or pick up a special trait from
 one of the many creatures in the Monster Manual. For example, you can 
create a goblin-spider hybrid by giving the normal goblin the Spider 
Climb special trait, turn an ordinary troll into a two-headed troll by 
giving it the Two Heads special trait, or turn an owlbear into a flying 
owlbear by giving it wings and a giant owl's flying speed.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="990" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating Quick Monster Stats</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p274</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>If
 all you need are simple stats for a monster of a particular challenge 
rating, follow the steps here. If you want to create something more akin

 don't normally have vulnerability to more than one or two types of 
damage. Vulnerabilities don't significantly affect a monster's challenge
 rating, unless a monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types 
that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For 
such a strange monster, reduce its effective hit points by half. Or even

 creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a weapon that is sized 
for a larger attacker. You can rule that a weapon sized for an attacker 
two or more sizes larger is too big for the creature to use at all.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1023" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Overall Damage Output.</span></span> <p>To
 determine a monster's overall damage output, take the average damage it
 deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them together. If a 
monster has different attack options, use the monster's most effective 
attacks to determine its damage output. For example, a fire giant can 
make two greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The 
greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack routine determines 
the fire giant's damage output.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>If
 a monster's damage output varies from round to round, calculate its 
damage output each round for the first three rounds of combat, and take 
the average. For example, a young white dragon has a multiattack routine
 (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals an average of 37 
damage each round, as well as a breath weapon that deals 45 damage, or 
90 if it hits two targets (and it probably will). In the first three 
rounds of combat, the dragon will probably get to use its breath weapon 
once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average damage output for
 the first three rounds would be (90 + 37 + 37) ÷ 3, or 54 damage 
(rounded down).</p><p>When calculating a monster's damage output, also 
account for special off-turn damage-dealing features, such as auras, 
reactions, legendary actions, or lair actions. For example, a balor's 
Fire Aura deals 10 fire damage to any creature that hits the balor with a
 melee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all creatures 
within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each of the balor's turns. If
 you assume that one character in the party is within 5 feet of the 
balor at all times, hitting it with a melee weapon every round, then the
 balor's damage output per round increases by 20.</p></div><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="1024" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Attack Riders</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p278</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>Many

 B of the Monster Manual contains stat blocks for common NPC archetypes 
such as bandits and guards, as well as tips for customizing them. Those 
tips include adding racial traits from the Player's Handbook, equipping 
NPCs with magic items, and swapping armor, weapons, and spells.</p><p>If
 you want to take an NPC stat block and adapt it for a specific monster 
race, apply the ability modifiers and add the features listed in the NPC
 Features table. If the NPC's AC, hit points, attack bonus, or damage 
changes, recalculate its challenge rating.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1042" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating NPCs from Scratch</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p282</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>If you need completely new statistics for an NPC, you have two options:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">You
 can create an NPC stat block (similar to the ones in the Monster 
Manual) as you would a monster stat block, as discussed in the previous 
section.</li><li class="rd__li ">You can build the NPC as you would a player character, as discussed in the Player's Handbook.</li></ul><p>If
 you decide to build an NPC the same way you build a player character, 
you can skip choosing a background and instead pick two skill 
proficiencies for the NPC.</p><p>The NPC Features table summarizes the 
ability modifiers and features of various nonhuman races, as well as 
various creatures from the Monster Manual with a challenge rating lower 
than 1. Apply these modifiers and add these features to the NPC's stat 
block, then determine the NPC's challenge rating just as you would for a
 monster. Features that can affect a monster's challenge rating are 
listed in the Monster Features table. The NPC's proficiency bonus is 
determined by its level, just like a character, rather than by its 
challenge rating.</p><p>If the monster you want to use isn't listed on the table, use the process described below under "Monsters with Classes."</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1043">NPC Features</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Race</th><th class="col-3" data-rd-isroller="false">Ability Modifiers</th><th class="col-6" data-rd-isroller="false">Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-3">Aarakocra</td><td class="col-3">+2 Dex, +2 Wis</td><td class="col-6">Dive Attack: talon attack action, speed 20 ft., fly 50 ft., speaks Auran</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Bullywug</td><td class="col-3">-2 Int, -2 Cha</td><td class="col-6">Amphibious, Speak with Frogs and Toads, Swamp Camouflage, Standing Leap: speed 20 ft., swim 40 ft.: speaks Bullywug</td></tr><tr><td class="col-3">Dragonborn*</td><td class="col-3">+2 Str, +1 Cha</td><td class="col-6">Breath

 can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook to give class 
levels to a monster. For example, you can turn an ordinary werewolf into
 a werewolf with four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster 
would be expressed as "Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian").</p><p>Start with
 the monster's stat block. The monster gains all the class features for 
every class level you add, with the following exceptions:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The monster doesn't gain the starting equipment of the added class.</li><li class="rd__li ">For
 each class level you add, the monster gains one Hit Die of its normal 
type (based on its size), ignoring the class's Hit Die progression.</li><li class="rd__li ">The monster's proficiency bonus is based on its challenge rating, not its class levels.</li></ul><p>Once
 you finish adding class levels to a monster, feel free to tweak its 
ability scores as you see fit (for example, raising the monster's 
Intelligence score so that the monster is a more effective wizard), and 
make whatever other adjustments are needed. You'll need to recalculate 
its challenge rating as though you had designed the monster from 
scratch.</p><p>Depending on the monster and the number of class levels 
you add to it, its challenge rating might change very little or increase
 dramatically. For example, a werewolf that gains four barbarian levels 
is a much greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit 
points, spells, and other class features that an ancient red dragon 
gains from five levels of wizard don't increase its challenge rating.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="1045" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating a Spell</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p283</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When creating a new spell, use existing spells as guidelines.

 spells that have very limited use, such as one that works only against 
good dragons. Though such a spell could exist in the world, few 
characters will bother to learn or prepare it unless they know in 
advance that doing so will be worthwhile.</li><li class="rd__li ">Make 
sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. Wizards and 
sorcerers don't typically have access to healing spells, for example, 
and adding a healing spell to the wizard class list would step on the 
cleric's turf.</li></ul><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1046" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Spell Damage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p283</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>For
 any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage table to determine 
approximately how much damage is appropriate given the spell's level. 
The table assumes the spell deals half damage on a successful saving 
throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn't deal damage on a 
successful save, you can increase the damage by 25 percent.</p><p>You 
can use different damage dice than the ones in the table, provided that 
the average result is about the same. Doing so can add a little variety

 magic items in chapter 7, "Treasure," are but a few of the magic 
treasures that characters can discover during their adventures. If your 
players are seasoned veterans and you want to surprise them, you can 
either modify an existing item or come up with something new.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1051" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Modifying an Item</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p284</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an existing one. If a 
paladin uses a flail as her main weapon, you could change a holy avenger
 so that it's a flail instead of a sword. You can turn a ring of the ram
 into a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of protection, all
 without altering the item's properties.</p><p>Other substitutions are 
equally easy. An item that deals damage of one type can easily deal 
damage of another type. A flame tongue sword could deal lightning damage
 instead of fire, for example. One capability can replace another, so a 
potion of climbing can easily become a potion of stealth.</p><p>You can also modify an item by fusing it with properties from another item. For example, you could combine the effects of a <i>helm of comprehending languages</i> with those of a <i>helm of telepathy</i> into a single helmet. This makes the item more powerful (and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break your game.</p><p>Finally,
 remember the tools that are provided for modifying items in chapter 7, 
"Treasure." Giving an item an interesting minor property, a quirk, or 
sentience can alter its flavor significantly.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1052" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating a New Item</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p284</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>If
 modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can create one from 
scratch. A magic item should either let a character do something he or 
she couldn't do before, or improve the character's ability to do 
something he or she can do already. For example, the ring of jumping 
lets its wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what a character
 can already do. A ring of the ram, however, gives a character the 
ability to deal force damage.</p><p>The simpler your approach, the 
easier it is for a character to use the item in play. Giving the item 
charges is fine, especially if it has several different abilities, but 
simply deciding that an item is always active or can be used a fixed 
number of times per day is easier to manage.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1053" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Power Level.</span></span> <p>If
 you make an item that lets a character kill whatever he or she hits

 section teaches you how to modify existing races, as well as create new
 ones. The most important step in customizing or designing races for 
your campaign is to start with the story behind the race or subrace you 
wish to create. Having a firm idea of a race's story in your campaign 
will help you make decisions during the creation process. Ask yourself 
several questions:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Why does my campaign need the race to be playable?</li><li class="rd__li ">What does the race look like?</li><li class="rd__li ">Where do the members of this race live?</li><li class="rd__li ">Are there interesting conflicts built into the race's history that make the race compelling from a storytelling standpoint?</li><li class="rd__li ">What is the race's relationship to the other playable races?</li><li class="rd__li ">What classes and backgrounds are well suited to members of the race?</li><li class="rd__li ">What are the race's signature traits?</li><li class="rd__li ">In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from the other subraces of the parent race?</li></ul><p>Compare
 the race you have in mind with the other race options available to 
players, to make sure that the new race doesn't pale in comparison to 
the existing options (which would result in the race being unpopular) or
 completely overshadow them (so that players don't feel as if the other 
options are inferior).</p><p>When the time comes to design the game 
elements of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game's 
existing races and let them inspire you.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1060" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cosmetic Alterations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p285</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 simple way to modify an existing race is to change its appearance. 
Changes to a race's appearance need not affect its game elements. For

 changing their racial traits at all.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1061" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating a New Subrace</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p285</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Creating
 a new subrace is more involved than making some minor tweaks to 
existing racial features, but it does have the advantage of increasing 
the diversity of options for a particular race, rather than replacing 
some options with other ones.</p><p>The following example walks through 
the creation of an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in
 the D&amp;D multiverse, so you already have some stories to draw on 
when building its traits.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1062" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Example Subrace: Eladrin</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p286</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Creatures
 of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm
 of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material 
Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades 
before fading back into the Feywild.</p><p>The elf subraces in the 
Player's Handbook include an ability score increase, a weapon training 
feature, and two or three additional traits. Given the story of the 
eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an eladrin character's 
Intelligence is appropriate. There's no need to alter the basic weapon 
training shared by high elves and wood elves.</p><p>An ability that sets
 the eladrin apart from other elves is their ability to step through the
 boundary between the planes, disappearing for a moment before 
reappearing somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a limited 
use of the misty step spell. Since misty step is a 2nd-level spell, this
 ability is potent enough that the subrace doesn't need additional 
traits.

usually rise to the top, becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes.</p><p>You
 might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoint to the tiefling race.
 The two races could even be at odds, reflecting some greater conflict 
between the forces of good and evil in your campaign.</p><p>Here are our basic goals for the aasimar:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins.</li><li class="rd__li ">Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what tieflings are to fiends and humans.</li></ul><p>Given
 that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of the same coin, the 
tiefling makes a good starting point for coming up with the new race's 
traits. Since we want aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it 
makes sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead of Intelligence
 and Charisma.</p><p>Like tieflings, aasimar have darkvision. Instead of
 resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance to radiant damage to
 reflect their celestial nature. However, radiant damage isn't as common
 as fire damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage as well, 
making them good at facing undead.</p><p>The tiefling's Infernal Legacy 
trait is a good model for a similar trait to reflect a magical, 
celestial heritage, replacing the tiefling's spells with spells of 
similar levels that more closely match the aasimar's celestial ancestry.
 However, the aasimar's expanded resistance might require limiting this 
trait to basic utility spells.</p><p>Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the following <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#aasimar_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="aasimar_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">racial traits for the aasimar</a>.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1065" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Modifying a Class</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p287</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 classes in the Player's Handbook capture a wide range of character 
archetypes, but your campaign world might have need of something more. 
The following section discusses ways to modify existing classes to 
better serve your game's needs.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1066" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Changing Proficiencies</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p287</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Changing
 a class's proficiencies is a safe and simple way to modify a class to 
better reflect your world. Swapping out one skill or tool proficiency 
for another doesn't make a character any stronger or weaker, but doing 
so can change the flavor of a class in subtle ways.</p><p>For example, a
 prominent guild of rogues in your world might worship a patron deity, 
performing secret missions in that deity's name. To reflect this 
cultural detail, you could add Religion to the list of skills that a 
rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could even mandate that
 skill as one of the choices for rogues who belong to this guild.</p><p>You
 can also change armor and weapon proficiencies to reflect certain 
aspects of your world. For example, you could decide that the clerics of
 a particular deity belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of 
material goods, other than magic items useful for their divine mission. 
Such clerics carry a staff, but they are forbidden from wearing armor or
 using weapons other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove 
the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this faith, making 
them proficient with the quarterstaff and nothing else. You could give 
them a benefit to make up for the loss of proficiencies something like 
the monk's Unarmored Defense class feature, but presented as a divine 
blessing.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1067" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Changing Spell Lists</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p287</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Modifying
 a class's spell list usually has little effect on a character's power 
but can change the flavor of a class significantly. In your world, 
paladins might not swear their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty
 to powerful sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build a
 new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect their masters, 
drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. Suddenly, the paladin feels 
like a different class.</p><p>Be cautious when changing the warlock 
spell list. Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, 
they have the potential to use certain spells more times in a day than 
other classes do.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1068" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Restricting Class Access</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p287</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Without
 changing the way a class functions, you can root it more firmly in the 
world by associating the class with a particular race or culture.</p><p>For
 example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards 
represent the magical traditions of four different races or cultures. 
The bardic colleges might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn
 might be the only creatures capable of becoming sorcerers, and all 
warlocks in your world might be human. You could break that down still 
further: bards of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards of 
the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes discovered the school of 
illusion, so all wizards who specialize in that school are gnomes. 
Different human cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and so 
on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect entirely separate 
religions associated with different races or cultures.</p><p>You decide 
how flexible you want to be in allowing a player character to break 
these restrictions. Can a half-elf live among the elves and study their 
bardic traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact despite 
having no connection to a culture that normally produces warlocks? As 
always, it's better to say yes and use the player's desire as an 
opportunity to develop the character's story and that of your world, 
rather than shutting down possibilities.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1069" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Substituting Class Features</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p287</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>If
 one or more features of a given class don't exactly fit the theme or 
tone of your campaign, you can pull them out of the class and replace 
them with new ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure that the
 new options are just as appealing as the ones you are removing, and 
that the substitute class features contribute to the class's 
effectiveness at social interaction, exploration, or combat just as well
 as those being replaced.</p><p>Ultimately, a class exists to help a 
player express a particular character concept, and any class feature you
 replace is also removing an aspect of that character. Substituting a 
class feature should be done only to fit a specific need for your 
campaign, or to appeal to a player trying to create a specific kind of 
character (perhaps one modeled after a character from a novel, TV 
series, comic book, or movie).</p><p>The first step is to figure out 
what class feature or group of class features you're going to replace. 
Then you need to evaluate what each feature provides to the class, so 
that the features you are adding don't make the class over- or 
underpowered. Ask yourself the following questions about a feature 
you're replacing:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">What impact does replacing the feature have on exploration, social interaction, or combat?</li><li class="rd__li ">Does replacing the feature affect how long the party can continue adventuring in a day?</li><li class="rd__li ">Does the feature consume resources provided elsewhere in the class?</li><li class="rd__li ">Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained after a short rest, a long rest, or some other length of time?</li></ul><p>Armed
 with answers to these questions, you can start designing new features 
that replace the ones you are removing. It's fine if the new class 
features drift closer to exploration, social interaction, or combat than
 the ones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far. For example, 
if you replace an exploration-focused feature with something purely 
combat focused, you've just made that class more powerful in combat, and
 it could overshadow the other classes in a way that you didn't intend.</p><p>There's
 no formula that can tell you how to design new class features. The best
 place to start is by looking at other class features, or at spells, 
feats, or any other rules for inspiration. You're almost certainly going
 to have some missteps, as features that seem good on the surface fall 
apart in play. That's all right. Everything you design will need to be 
playtested. When introducing new class features, be sure the players 
using them are comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back 
and make some changes after seeing them in play.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1070" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating New Class Options</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p288</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Each
 class has at least one major choice point. Clerics choose a divine 
domain, fighters choose a martial archetype, wizards choose an arcane 
tradition, and so forth. Creating a new option doesn't require you to 
remove anything from the class, but any new option you add should be 
compared to existing options to make sure it's no more or less powerful,
 yet remains distinctive in flavor. Like anything in class design, be 
prepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if things aren't 
playing out the way you want them to.</p><p>Once you have the concept 
for the class option in mind, it's time to design the specifics. If 
you're not sure where to begin, look at the existing options and see 
what class features they provide. It's perfectly acceptable for two 
class options to have similar features, and it's also fine to look at 
other classes for examples of mechanics you can draw on for inspiration.
 As you design each class feature, ask the following questions:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">How does the class feature reinforce the story or theme of the class option?</li><li class="rd__li ">Is there an existing feature that can be used as a model?</li><li class="rd__li ">How does the new class feature compare to other features of the same level?</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1071" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Variant: Spell Points</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p288</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>One
 way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. 
With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature 
uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a
 caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.</p><p>In 
this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell 
Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st 
to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require 
spell points.</p><p>Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast 
your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell 
points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell 
slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't
 reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent
 spell points when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Spells of 6th level and
 higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to 
create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another
 slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.</p><p>The number 
of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a 
spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level 
also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though
 you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you 
can't do so.</p><p>The Spell Points by Level table applies to <a href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#bard_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="classes.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="bard_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">bards</a>, <a href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#cleric_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="classes.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="cleric_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">clerics</a>, <a href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#druid_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="classes.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="druid_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">druid</a>, <a href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#sorcerer_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="classes.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="sorcerer_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">sorcerers</a>, and <a href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#wizard_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="classes.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="wizard_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">wizards</a>.

 well-crafted background can help a player create a character that feels
 like an exciting addition to your campaign. It helps define the 
character's place in the world, rather than what a character is in terms
 of game mechanics.</p><p>Instead of focusing on a generic character 
background, such as merchant or wanderer, think about the factions, 
organizations, and cultures of your campaign and how they might be 
leveraged to create flavorful backgrounds for player characters. For 
example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep background that is 
functionally similar to a sage background, but which ties a character 
more closely to a place and organization in your world.</p><p>A 
character with the acolyte of Candlekeep background probably has friends
 among the Avowed the monks who maintain the great library at 
Candlekeep. The character can enter the library and consult its lore 
freely, while others must donate a rare or valuable tome of knowledge 
before they are allowed entry. Candlekeep's enemies are the character's 
enemies, and its allies, the character's friends. Acolytes of Candlekeep
 are generally regarded as learned sages and protectors of knowledge.

 the character's background and approach the character in search of 
assistance.</p><p>To create your own background, follow these steps.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1075" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Step 1.

five candles, a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the symbol

 be a gift given to an acolyte of Candlekeep who embarks on a life of

 an existing background feature or create a new one, as you prefer. If

have the Researcher feature of the sage (as presented in the Player's 
Handbook), with the additional benefit that the character is allowed to 
enter Candlekeep without paying the normal cost.</p><p>A background 
feature should avoid strict game benefits, such as a bonus to an ability
 check or an attack roll. Instead, the feature should open up new 
options for roleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with the 
world.</p><p>For example, the sage's Researcher feature is designed to 
send the character on adventures. It doesn't provide information or an 
automatic success for a check. Instead, if a character with the sage 
background fails to recall information, he or she instead knows where to
 learn it. This might be a pointer to another sage or to a library long

 appendix helps you quickly generate a dungeon. The tables work in an 
iterative manner. First, roll a starting area, then roll to determine 
the passages and doors found in that area. One you have initial passages
 and doors, determine the location and nature of subsequent passages, 
doors, chambers, stairs, and so on-each of them generated by rolls on 
different tables.</p><p>Following these instructions can lead to 
sprawling complexes that more than fill a single sheet of graph paper. 
If you want to constrain the dungeon, establish limits ahead of time on 
how far it can grow. The most obvious limit to a dungeon's size is the 
graph paper it's drawn on. If a feature would exceed the boundaries of 
the page, curtail it. A corridor might turn or come to a dead end at the
 map's edge, or you can make a chamber smaller to fit the available 
space.</p><p>Alternatively, you can decide that passages leading off the
 edge of the map are additional dungeon entrances. Stairs, shafts, and 
other features that would normally lead to levels you don't plan to map 
can serve a similar purpose.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="1081" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Starting Area</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p290</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Starting Area table produces a chamber or a set of corridors at the 
entrance to your dungeon. When rolling for a random starting area, pick 
one of the doors or passages leading into the starting area as the 
entrance to the dungeon as a whole.</p><p>Once you've selected the 
entrance, roll on the appropriate table for each passage or door leading
 away from the starting area. Passages each extend 10 feet beyond the 
starting area. After that point, check on the Passage table for each 
passage to determine what lies beyond. Use the Beyond a Door table to 
determine what lies behind doors and secret doors.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1082">Starting Area</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 your map is done, consider adding doors between chambers and passages 
that are next to each other but otherwise not connected. Such doors 
create more paths through the dungeon and expand players' options.</p><p>If
 your dungeon consists of more than one level, be sure that any stairs, 
pits, and other vertical passages line up between levels. If you're 
using graph paper, lay a new page on top of your existing map, mark the 
locations of stairs and other features shared by the two levels, and 
begin mapping the new level.</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="1097" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Stocking a Dungeon</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p292</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Creating
 a map for your dungeon is only half the fun. Once you have the layout, 
you need to decide what challenges and rewards are to be found in the 
dungeon's passages and chambers. Any reasonably large space should be 
stocked with interesting sights, sounds, objects, and creatures.</p><p>You
 don't need to have every last detail of your dungeon plotted out. You 
can get by with nothing more than a list of monsters, a list of 
treasures, and a list of one or two key elements for each dungeon area.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1098" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chamber Purpose</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p292</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A room's purpose can help determine its furnishings and other contents.</p><p>For
 each chamber on your dungeon map, establish its purpose or use the 
tables below to generate ideas. Each type of dungeon described in the 
"Dungeon Purpose" section of chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," has 
its own table featuring chambers geared to the dungeon's purpose. For 
example, if you're building a tomb, use the Dungeon: Tomb table to help 
you determine the purpose of each chamber. These dungeon-specific tables
 are followed by the General Dungeon Chambers table, which you can use 
if your dungeon isn't an exact fit for one of the standard types of 
dungeon or if you want to mix things up.</p><p>Relying on random rolls 
to stock an entire dungeon can lead to incongruous results. A tiny room 
might end up being identified as a temple, while the huge chamber next 
door serves as storage. It can be fun to try to make sense of such 
strange design ideas, but make changes as you see fit. You can set aside
 a few key rooms and create specific contents for them.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1099">Dungeon: Death Trap</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

you can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose contents, be 
sure to include an interesting, colorful assortment of things. In 
addition to the contents shown on this table, refer to "Dungeon

fill rooms.</p><p>In the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a "dominant 
inhabitant" is a creature that controls an area. Pets and allied

 are scavengers or nuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups

crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust monsters. See chapter 3,
 "Creating Adventures," for more information on random encounters.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1112">Dungeon Chamber Contents</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for guidance on creating encounters 
with monsters. To foster variety and suspense, be sure to include 
encounters of varying difficulty.</p><p>A powerful creature encountered 
early in the dungeon sets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to
 rely on their wits. For example, an ancient red dragon might slumber on
 the first level of a dungeon, a pall of smoke and the sound of its 
heavy breathing filling the chambers near its lair. Clever characters 
will do their utmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party's brave 
thief makes off with a few coins from its hoard.</p><p>Not all monsters 
are automatically hostile. When placing monsters in your dungeon, 
consider their relationships to nearby creatures and their attitudes 
toward adventurers. Characters might be able to appease a hungry beast 
by offering it food, and smarter creatures have complex motivations. The
 Monster Motivation table lets you use a monster's goals to define its 
presence in the dungeon.</p><p>For large groups of monsters encountered 
across multiple chambers, motivation could apply to the entire group, or
 each subgroup could have conflicting goals.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1114">Monster Motivation</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 a map for an adventure is a fun, challenging, and time-consuming 
endeavor. However, unless you have something specific in mind, you're 
better off conserving your time and energy by repurposing an existing
