I act based on instinct, rarely with a plan.
I am cowed by threats, and even preposterous ones make me pause.
Deep down, I know I am doomed to anonymity.
My natural inclination is to grovel and beg for the fa- vor ofthose stronger than me.
I rage, but I use anger to distract from my fear ofcon- frontation.
I become entangled and betrayed by my own machinations.
