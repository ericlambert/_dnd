I enjoy telling lies.
Threats are my only language.
I fawn over others to make my betrayal more unexpected.
I crush those I can defeat, and lie in wait to weaken and overwhelm those I must respect.
I will do anything to survive. Anything.
Someday all will worship me. Until then, I track their insults with obsessive attention.
