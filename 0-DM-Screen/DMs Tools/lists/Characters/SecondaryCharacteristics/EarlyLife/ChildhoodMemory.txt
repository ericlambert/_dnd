I am still haunted by my childhood, when I was treated badly by my peers.
I spent most of my childhood alone, with no close friends.
Others saw me as being different or strange, and so I had few companions.
I had a few close friends and lived an ordinary childhood.
I had several friends, and my childhood was generally a happy one.
I always found it easy to make friends, and I loved being around people.
Everyone knew who I was, and I had friends everywhere I went.
