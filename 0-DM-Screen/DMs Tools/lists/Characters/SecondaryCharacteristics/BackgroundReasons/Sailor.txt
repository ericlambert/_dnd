I was press-ganged by pirates and forced to serve on their ship until I finally escaped.
I wanted to see the world, so I signed on as a deckhand for a merchant ship.
One of my relatives was a sailor who took me to sea.
I needed to escape my community quickly, so I stowed away on a ship. When the crew found me, I was forced to work for my passage.
Reavers attacked my community, so I found refuge on a ship until I could seek vengeance.
I had few prospects where I was living, so I left to find my fortune elsewhere.
