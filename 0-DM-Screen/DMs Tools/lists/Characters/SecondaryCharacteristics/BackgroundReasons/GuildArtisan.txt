I was apprenticed to a master who taught me the guildâ€™s business.
I helped a guild artisan keep a secret or complete a task, and in return I was taken on as an apprentice.
One of my family members who belonged to the guild made a place for me.
I was always good with my hands, so I took the opportunity to learn a trade.
I wanted to get away from my home situation and start a new life.
I learned the essentials of my craft from a mentor but had to join the guild to finish my training.
