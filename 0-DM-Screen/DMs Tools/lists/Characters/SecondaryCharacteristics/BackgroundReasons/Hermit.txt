My enemies ruined my reputation, and I fled to the wilds to avoid further disparagement.
I am comfortable with being isolated, as I seek inner peace.
I never liked the people I called my friends, so it was easy for me to strike out on my own.
I felt compelled to forsake my past, but did so with great reluctance, and sometimes I regret making that decision.
I lost everything — my home, my family, my friends. Going it alone was all I could do.
Society’s decadence disgusted me, so I decided to leave it behind.
