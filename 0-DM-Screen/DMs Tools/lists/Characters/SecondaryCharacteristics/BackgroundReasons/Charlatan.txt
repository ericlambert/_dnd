I was left to my own devices, and my knack for manipulating others helped me survive.
I learned early on that people are gullible and easy to exploit.
I often got in trouble, but I managed to talk my way out of it every time.
I took up with a confidence artist, from whom I learned my craft.
After a charlatan fleeced my family, I decided to learn the trade so I would never be fooled by such deception again.
I was poor or I feared becoming poor, so I learned the tricks I needed to keep myself out of poverty.
