# Skycoach Ride

While the characters were off rescuing Caden d’Orien, Garra captured and interrogated Sergeant Vilroy and learned about the characters’ meddling. In this section, Garra orders a changeling named Jas to adopt Sergeant Vilroy’s appearance and lead the characters into a trap.
Need a Lift?

Jas (neutral evil changeling; see chapter 6) approaches the characters in the guise of Sergeant Vilroy sometime after they leave Mithral Tower. Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players when this occurs:

> As you cross a bridge that views the city from a dizzying height, you hear a familiar voice from above. “Need a lift?” asks Sergeant Vilroy as she descends toward you in a skycoach.

“Vilroy” urges the characters to board the skycoach and share what they have learned thus far. If the characters mention Garra’s safe house, the changeling tells them there’s no time to waste and suggests the skycoach is the fastest means of getting there. If the characters ask the sergeant how she found them, the changeling replies, “I work for the Sharn Watch. Knowing things is my job!” If the characters accept the ride, the skycoach takes them to area T1 of Terminus. Unknown to Jas, Garra has also arranged for a Daask strike team to attack the skycoach en route.

Any character who suspects that “Vilroy” is hiding something can make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the changeling’s Charisma (Deception) check. A character who wins the contest detects slight differences in the sergeant’s facial expressions, suggesting that she’s not the same person the party interacted with previously. Jas doesn’t have details of any prior conversations the party had with the real Sergeant Vilroy and flubs any sustained questioning.

If the characters realize they’re not dealing with the real Sergeant Vilroy and confront the changeling, Jas leaps out of the skycoach, uses a feather token to land safely, and flees into the crowded city. Each character has one turn to act before the unpiloted skycoach crashes. A character proficient with air vehicles who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence check as an action gains control of the skycoach and stops it from falling. If the coach crashes, the characters are thrown from it as it hurdles down. Use the Falling in Sharn table in chapter 3 to determine what happens to characters who fall. The party has three rounds to catch Jas before the changeling adopts a new guise.

If the characters capture Jas, the changeling reveals that Garra is leaving Sharn on a lightning rail bound for Wroat. The changeling doesn’t know about Garra’s trap and simply has instructions to deliver the characters.

## Daask Gnolls

As the characters travel to Terminus either on foot or by skycoach, they are accosted by a Daask strike team consisting of five gnolls. Garra has sent the gnolls to kill the characters if possible, or at least soften them up before they arrive at her Terminus safe house. You can describe them to the players as follows:

> Zipping between the towers of Sharn and converging on your location are five creatures riding disks of crackling green energy. Each creature is a lanky humanoid covered in fur, with the head of a hyena. They cackle maniacally, nock arrows, and take aim at you with their longbows.

Each gnoll rides a magical, 3-foot-diameter disk that can support up to 250 pounds. A creature on a disk can use its bonus action to move the disk up to 60 feet in any direction — fast enough to keep pace with the skycoaches of Sharn. A disk otherwise hovers in place. These disks were created using a spell similar to Tenser’s floating disk that was cast by a Daask wizard who does not appear in this adventure. The spell ends in 30 minutes, after which the disks disappear.

The gnolls initially keep their distance, peppering the characters with arrows. The gnolls become frustrated and close to melee range if the characters take advantage of cover and the gnolls’ ranged attacks prove ineffective. Once three gnolls are disposed of, the remainder flee on their disks or on foot.
