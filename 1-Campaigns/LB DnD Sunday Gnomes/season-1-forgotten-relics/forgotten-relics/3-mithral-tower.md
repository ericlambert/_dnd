# Mithral Tower

[Official Text](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/erftlw/building-eberron-adventures-forgotten-relics#MithralTower)

## Entering the district

> Mithral Tower is a highly sought-after residential district in Upper Central Plateau, located in the heart of Sharn. The district is home to some of the wealthiest citizens of the city, who occupy grand homes adorned with mithral filigree. As the characters enter this district, they will be struck by the opulence of their surroundings, with busy scions climbing into skycoaches, hosting lavish parties, and flaunting their latest purchases at all hours of the day. However, the Sharn Watch can be seen patrolling the neighborhood, ensuring that the peace is maintained.

## Arriving at Unicorn Estate

> The Unicorn Estate is one of the many grand homes located in Mithral Tower. Upon arrival, the characters will need to present themselves to the guards at the gate and state their business before they are allowed to enter the property. The estate is decorated with a grand unicorn statue and unicorn-shaped topiaries, which serve as a testament to the wealth and power of the dragonmarked family that owns it.
>
> The two guards stationed at the gate wear House Orien livery and are equipped with helmets shaped like unicorn heads. Beyond the gate, a magnificent marble home can be seen, owned by one of the wealthiest dragonmarked families in the city. On the patio, two figures can be seen engaged in quiet conversation: a haggard man in his late thirties and an attentive kalashtar who holds a rose-colored crystal in his hands. Two more guards dressed like the ones at the gates stand nearby, watching the estate's surroundings for any potential threats.

## Describing Alden

> Alden d'Orien, a Brelish human noble of House Orien is in his mid-forties. He is tall, standing at around 6'1", with a lean build and a slightly stooped posture that suggests exhaustion. His once-handsome features are now marred by stress, worry lines etched deep into his forehead and around his mouth. His short hair is a dark brown, tinged with gray at the temples. He wears fine, well-tailored clothing, but it hangs loosely on his frame, emphasizing his worn appearance.
>
> Alden sits slumped in a high-backed chair in his opulent study in the city of Sharn. Normally charming and inviting, he looks anything but, with dark circles under his eyes and a haggard expression on his face. He is dressed in a fine silk robe, which hangs loosely on his slender frame, as if he hasn't slept or eaten in days.
>
> As you approach him, he looks up wearily, his eyes red and puffy from crying. He seems almost surprised to see you, as if he didn't expect anyone to come looking for him. He motions for you to take a seat, but his body language suggests that he'd rather be left alone.
>
> Despite his obvious distress, Alden tries to maintain a veneer of composure. He sits up straight in his chair, his posture rigid, and his eyes darting around as if searching for something.
>
> When he asks about your business. Alden's normally smooth voice is hoarse, and he speaks in terse, clipped sentences. He seems to be on edge, as if any moment could set him off.

## Roleplaying Alden

### on a successful DC 8 Insight or Passive Insight check

> You can tell that Alden is a man under a great deal of pressure, and that he's holding back a torrent of emotion. You'll need to be careful how you approach him if you hope to get any information out of him.

### The moment the Daask, the Sharn Watch, or Coal are mentioned

- Alden badly wants to rescue his son but is terrified of taking action and seeing Caden harmed.
- Caden was abducted almost a month ago. Alden tucked him in one night, he was gone the following morning with a message in his place.
- A hulking half-ogre met with Alden in the following days, explaining she needed expendable labor and easy transit of said labor and goods. As long as he complied, Caden would be returned unharmed when her business was done.
- If Alden backed out of the deal, the half-ogre said she would visit horrors on Caden that would make the Mockery sick.
- Alden breaks down sobbing after relaying this information and staggers inside.
- Alden seems to be worried about his son, Caden, but he hasn't yet informed his wife, Iyana, who lives in distant Fairhaven with her sister.

> Alden he becomes visibly agitated, placing his hands over his face and emitting a strangled scream.


## Describing Vishtai

> Vishtai, Alden's assistant, is a kalashtar in his early thirties. He is slightly shorter than Alden, standing at around 5'10", with a slim build and a calm, measured demeanor. His skin is a deep bronze, and his features are sharp and angular. His hair is a glossy black, pulled back into a neat ponytail. He wears simple, practical clothing, with a spellshard attached to his belt. Despite his serious expression, there is a kindness in his eyes that suggests he genuinely cares for Alden and his family.


### Roleplaying Vishtai

Vishtai is Alden’s confidant and knows all about the situation with Daask. He hates bullies and pushes for Alden to try to rescue his son rather than to keep giving in to Daask’s demands. After the characters speak to Alden, Vishtai telepathically relays this message to them before hurrying to follow Alden inside:

> I have no doubt that Caden will die, regardless of Alden’s actions. There is an enclosed lift five buildings north of this estate. Look for the medusa inside. Make sure you’re alone, as this lift will take you down to the dig site and, hopefully, Caden.
>
> You see how broken the man is. Please, save Caden and return him to his father. House Orien would owe you a great debt.

If the party wishes to speak further, Vishtai will hurriedly offer the following bits of information:

- The kidnapper asked for warforged laborers, preferably from outside of Breland. These laborers are digging for something in a sparsely inhabited area of Old Sharn.
- The lift the characters must use has been modified in some way to reach Old Sharn.
- If the characters rescue Caden, Vishtai is certain that he and Alden can help them track down the kidnapper.

#### If asked about the Quori in general

> The plane of dreams, Dal Quor is dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark as they are known here.
>
> Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares—the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body.

#### If asked about his Kalashtar heritage

> Vishtai deflects the question, stating that he is not comfortable discussing such personal matters with strangers.

A successful history check

> Kalashtar culture places great importance on their relationship with their quori, as they are spiritual beings that reside within the kalashtar and help guide them in their lives. For most, discussing one's quori with someone outside of their immediate family or trusted community is considered taboo.
>
> If even another kalashtar were to ask Vishtai about his quori, he would likely be cautious in his response.

##### If pressed about his heritage

On a successful persuasion check

> Vishtai offers more but remains vague saying,
> "I am kalashtar, born of two worlds. Over a thousand years ago, my ancestor bound his bloodline to the spirit Kashtai, and I am a child of that union. Kashtai moves within me. His memories come to me in dreams, and at times his voice whispers in the silence of my mind. As long as at least one of my brothers is alive, Kashtai will survive — and as long as he lives, he will fight il-Lashtavar."

On a failed persuasion check

> Vishtai offers a polite but vague response, "I am grateful for the guidance of my quori, but I prefer to keep our bond private."


## Enclosed Lift

If the characters follow Vishtai’s directions, they find a lift with an enclosed car that Daask uses to reach the ruins of Old Sharn. Anyone wishing to use the lift must open a hidden panel and hot-wire it. An “out of order” sign hangs above a nearby button which opens the lift’s doors. When the doors open, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> The double doors on the enclosed lift car open to reveal the inside of a 15-foot cube made of stone with etchings of unicorn patterns covering its walls. A magic orb in the ceiling illuminates the lift.

### Young Love (optional based on time)

> Two young adults — a shifter and a well-dressed human — talk nose to nose, cradling each other’s faces in a corner of the elevator, absorbed fully in each other and taking no notice of you.

Luna (chaotic neutral female shifter; see chapter 6) and Vonnie ir’Cardwan (neutral female Brelish human noble) are having a secret date on the lift. This is where they first met, so it’s a frequent rendezvous. They are bemused by the interruption and politely ask the party to leave, pointing out the lift is broken and growing more insistent and annoyed if the characters don’t comply. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Diplomacy or Intimidation) check convinces the couple to leave the lift. If a character fails the Intimidation check or removes the secret panel (see “Medusa Panel” below), Vonnie gets upset and plainly states she is summoning the Watch and stalks away with Luna. Two minutes later, Vonnie returns with three city Watch guards and accuses them of harassing her, vandalizing the lift, or both. The guards arrest the party if the lift appears tampered with. Presenting Vilroy’s writ and explaining the situation causes the guards to back off. Hostile action toward the young lovers or the guards results the guards attempting to subdue the party.

### Medusa Panel

Upon entering the lift, the characters notice that the head of a medusa engraved amid all the unicorn heads hides the seams of a secret panel. A tool or weapon can be used to pry open the panel, behind which are several wires connecting the lift car to a small Eberron dragonshard. Each wire is connected to an individual pin-sized hole in the dragonshard. A character who is proficient in Arcana knows the dragonshard and wires control the movement of the lift. A character who makes a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) check finds a loose wire among those attached to the dragonshard and a hole in the dragonshard with no wire attached. A character who attaches the loose wire to the dragonshard causes the lift to descend into the ruins of Old Sharn. While that wire is attached to the crystal, the lift cannot be called anywhere else in the city.

### Bugbear Going Down (optional based on time)

If the characters can’t find the hidden panel or figure out how to get the lift to Old Sharn, eventually the lift goes down, called to the tavern district of Olladra’s Kitchen in Lower Central by Orgon, a male bugbear working for Daask. Orgon wants to go down to Old Sharn’s ruins to help guard the relic excavation site. If Luna and Vonnie are on the lift when Orgon enters, they leave immediately.

When Orgon enters the lift, he demands the characters get out of the car. If the characters don’t leave, Orgon attacks them. Orgon fights until reduced to 10 hit points then surrenders. A successful DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation) check gets Orgon to admit to being a member of Daask and gets him to show the characters how to bring the lift down to the ruins of Old Sharn.
