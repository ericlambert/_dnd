## Agenda

### Recap last session

#### Previously

> Yesterday evening, Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch has asked you to meet with a warforged named Coal at a bar called Cog Carnival in the Tavik's Landing neighborhood of High Wall.
>
>After agreeing to the task, you enbarked on some shopping to prepare for your work. A on quiet street in the Dava Gate District you found The Storm's Forge where Drogan and his assistant Tilda
>
> Also on the same street you visited an animal shelter, where you were almost adopted a mastif but were disuaded by the adoption form's first question... **Are you planning on taking this animal with you on an adventure? __Yes / __No**. You left the shelter dogless but did acquire a goldfish. You named it "George".
>
> Germaine had reserved rooms for each of you at the world renowned Ghallanda Hall so you began making your way to Middle Dura where the inn is located. Down an alley you encountered a stray Newfoundland. You were able to befriend the dog, took (**him**/her)? with you and as you strapped George's fishbowl to their back, you named the dog "Also George".
>
> You stayed the night at Ghallanda Hall. In the morning Lelie made a promising connection for her soap products with Marda Ghallanda, the cheerful halfling who manages the day-to-day operations of the inn. Then after breakfast you set off to find Coal.
>
> Soon after arriving at Cog Carnival, a makeshift bar in High Walls run by a warforged named Smelt. Takanishara called out loudly "Does anybody know Coal?". A warforged form with matte black coverings, broke for the door and as they did a bolt of fire exploded against the wall inches from their head. The bar was thrown into chaos and the chase is on!

##### Catching Coal

[Chase Rules](chase-rules.md)

##### Chatting with Coal

Coal, a neutral good warforged soldier, is missing her right arm. If the characters approach her without identifying that they work for Sergeant Vilroy, Coal immediately notifies the bartender, Smelt, that she’s being bothered by the party. If things start to get tense, Coal gets spooked and bugs out; move on to “Catching Coal,” below.
Chatting with Coal

If the characters mention Sergeant Vilroy as they meet Coal, she stays calm but still asks why Vilroy didn’t come herself. Vilroy’s explanation to the party about attracting attention soothes Coal, as does the party explaining they are Vilroy’s trusted confidants.

Once Coal is calmed, she hurriedly explains the kidnapping of a child from House Orien, the murder of her friend Razor, and Daask’s hunt for artifacts in Old Sharn. Just as Coal is finishing her exposition, a bolt of fire explodes inches from Coal’s head, causing bedlam in the Cog Carnival. Coal runs for her life, shouting that the party set her up. The chase is on!
