    "**Placing the town of Blueridge**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work it into the Eberron setting, I slightly adopted the town of Blueridge from the one-off adventure \"Dust Up in the Oasis\" by Alika Gupta.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blueridge lies on the banks of an oasis in the Blade Desert in the Talenta Plains region, some 400 miles east of Gatherhold (8 days travel by mounted dinosaur).\n",
    "\n",
    "The small settlement is populated by warforged that fought for the elves of Valenar in the Last War. Following the war, the elves seemed keen on further conflict (and still do today) and these warforged were not. So they fled Valenar north into the Blade Desert where the elves were unlikely to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "They followed the desert into Talenta and found a small oasis. The warforged took up residence calling the place Blueridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was about 2 years ago and some interesting dynamics begun developing with the collision of warforged with the tribal nomadic halflings.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gatherhold dwarfs the small community, Blueridge has come to be another, less formal, neutral meeting ground and trading post for tribes of Talenta halflings as they roam the arid planes and harsh desert.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unbeknownst to anyone, the oasis on which Blueridge formed is actually the product of a [manifest zone](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Manifest_zone) linking [Lamannia, the Twilight Forest](https://5e.tools/book.html#erlw,10,lamannia%2c%20the%20twilight%20forest,0) to Khorvair."

    "- The Talenta Plains are the ancestral homeland of all halflings.\n",
    "- The halflings inhabiting the Talenta Plains are nomadic and tribal. They have no cities and no industrialized magic.\n",
    "- Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.\n",
    "- The halflings domesticated the dinosaurs of the plains and use these creatures as mounts, livestock, and beasts of burden.\n",
    "- A sacred bond exists between a Talenta hunter and dinosaur mount. Few people are prepared to face a raging halfling barbarian riding a furious clawfoot raptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Knowledge**\n",
    "- Talenta warriors are often barbarians or rangers, relying on speed and skill. \n",
    "- Because of the central role that dinosaurs play in the life of the Talenta halflings, most wear a dinosaur mask and adorn themselves with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions. Some even adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms.\n",
    "- Talenta religion reveres spirits, both departed ancestors and natural spirits. Each tribe has a chieftain who guides the tribe and shamans who consult the spirits and choose the paths of migration.\n",
    "- Talentan halflings shun the ruins scattered across the Plains, believing them to be haunted by fiends.\n",
    "- Many tribes are organized around the type of dinosaur they have become adept at domesticating.\n",

    "  - [House Jorasco](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Jorasco)\n",
    "- The Talentan reverence for spirits derives from the fact that a variety of spirits haunt the Plains. The region contains an unusual number of manifest zones tied to Dolurrh and Thelanis. Ghosts are more likely to linger in such places, and minor fey are scattered across the Plains.\n",
    "- Settlers and merchants cross the Plains as they make their way to Q'barra, and they clash with Q'barran bandits.\n",
    "- The Valenar elves ride through the Plains in search of adventure."

    "**Encyclopedic Knowledge**\n",
    "- Lathon Halpum believes that if the tribes can work together, they could become a nation of nations, but others aggressively oppose such a path.\n",
