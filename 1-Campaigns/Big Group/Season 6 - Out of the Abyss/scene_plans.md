## Dock Ward Distraction

Once the game is over, Velgos casts a sending spell to contact Zord, who invites the characters to dine with him aboard the Eyecatcher. The captain of the Heartbreaker, Tarwind Arryhook transports the party to the Eyecatcher via rowboat.

Dining with Zardoz Zord. Characters who accept Zord's offer are shuttled by dinghy to his flagship by the captain of the Heartbreaker, Tarwind Arryhook. welcomed aboard by drow crew members magically disguised as attractive humans (see chapter 7 for more information) and led to the captain's dining cabin (area J10). Read the following out load:

The dining cabin is bedecked with golden filigree, the purple curtains festooned with silken tassels, the wood paneling scented with perfume. A pair of mechanical humanoids dressed as butlers tend to the finishing touchest of a magnificent feast laid out on golden platters sprawls atop a mahogany table of exquisite craftsmanship. Even the doilies are something to behold. Standing behind it all with wine glass in hand is a well-built, scantily clad man, his scarlet apparel designed to accentuate his trim figure and bountiful chest hair. A flashy rapier hangs from his stylish belt.

"Welcome aboard the Eyecatcher," he says, flashing his pearly white teeth. "Zardoz Zord. at your service. Please take a seat lets enjoy!"

The characters have piqued Zardoz’s curiosity. He doesn't know much about them (yet) and wants to determine whether they pose a threat (they don't). To win them over, he shares the following information over dinner and wine:

1. The Sea Maiden's Faire, owned and operated by Zord, is a seafaring carnival based in Luskan that travels along the Sword Coast. It provides good, wholesome entertainment in the form of fantastic street parades.
2. The Heartbreaker and the Hell raiser are used to transport entertainers, wagons, and parade floats. The Eyecatcher is Zord's command ship and private yacht. All three ships are built for comfort and speed.
3. Zord visits the distant island of Lantan about once a year. During his last visit, he purchased four nimblewrights from a Lantanese wizard. He keeps two aboard bis flagship, and one aboard each of the other two vessels.
4. When they're not marching in a parade, Zord's nimblewrights remain aboard his ships. "They're perfectly harmless," he attests, whereupon a nimblewright holding a decanter enters the dining cabin and quietly refills everyone's wine glasses.

If the characters mention the Stone of Golorr, Zord shrugs his shoulders in a manner that suggests he doesn't know what they're talking about. He also feigns disinterest in Waterdeep politics, saying,

"Every city has problems, l suppose. My job as an entertainer is to make people forget about politics for a while."

Characters who are suspicious of Zord can make a DC 24 Wisdom (Insight) check. Any character who succeeds on the check senses that there's much more to him than meets the eye.

Zardoz owns a hat of disguise but doesn't need it to hide his true form while he's aboard any of his ships. His disguise (and the disguises of his drow subordinates) can be dispelled only by destroying the ship's figurehead (see chapter 7).  If the characters somehow discern his true form, Jarlaxle gives the party a slow nod of his head, dryly says "Bravo!" and lets them make the next move.

As planned this scene should transition to the Quest Hook  Zardoz and the Soul Miners.

## Out of the Abyss - Chapter 1: Prisoners of the Drow

### Describe the party’s situation

Ask a player roll a 1d10 to determine the number of days imprisoned so far.

Read aloud the text under The Adventure Begins (pg 6 of Out of the Abyss).

### Describe the slave pen

The slave pen that you have been forced to call home for in recent days is a cavern about 60 ft long and 30 ft wide. It’s only opening is closed with a 15 ft wide heavy iron gate bolted into the stone on all sides. There are no comforts in the slave pen. Prisioners sit or lie on the stone floor and are fed a small clay bowl of thin mushroom broth once per day.

### Describe their Restraints

You and all of your fellow prisoners wear the same restrains. An iron collar around your neck, manacles on your wrists that are connected to an iron belt by a short length of chain. This restrains you but does not affect the normal range nor speed of your movement.

### Describe their Possessions

You have been stripped entirely of your gear including spell components and spell focuses. When you awoke you found yourself clothed in a simple cloth smock with nothing other than a clay chamber pot. However, you each may have scavenged one other item during your imprisonment so far.

Ask each player to roll a d20. Add to the result the number of days imprisoned. Lookup total on the Scavenged Possessions table.

Pause for player driven roleplaying.

### Describe the fellow prisoners

Aside from your group there are ten other prisoners in the slave pen. None of you have attempted to engage any of them in conversation yet. However by listening to their chatter and that of the drow you’ve seen you have gathered the following:

Your fellow prisoners were generally captured separately over time as the result of various raids.

They are awaiting transportation to Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. where some will likely be sold as slaves while others will be killed by the drow or their pets.

Some of these races may be unfamiliar to the players and their characters. For more details on these races see the following sources:

- **Derro** Out of the Abyss Appendix C: Creatures (page 225)
- **Quaggoth** Monster Manual (page 257)
- **Deep Gnome** Monster Manual (page 165)
- **Kuo-toa** Monster Manual (page 199-200)
- **Myconid** Monster Manual (page 231)

The other prisoners know the following and will freely tell the characters all of this.

***Pause for player driven roleplaying.***

### Describe their days so far

Each day you are awoken and divided into three groups. The groups seem arbitrary each day except that the drow seem always to separate prisoners who know each other as best they can.

Supervised by quaggoths, each group is put to work for about a third of a day doing menial tasks. No more than two or three work on the same task at a time.

- Filling and hauling water barrels
- Operating the lift to the cavern floor far below
- Cleaning all parts of the outpost
- Emptying chamber pots
- Food prep and service
- Washing dishes
- Laundry

### Roleplay a day as a prisoner

Determine work groups and assignments.
Arbitrarily split the prisoners into three groups. Intentionally split the party up as much as possible. Then roll 1d14 for each group to determine the area of the outpost they are assigned to.

1. Southern Watch Post
2. Barracks
3. Main Hall
4. Elite Barracks
5. Lift
6. Shrine to Lolth
7. Ilvara’s Quarters
8. Shoor’s Quarters
9. Waterfall
10. Guard Tower
11. Slave Pen
12. Quaggoth Den
13. Northern Watch Tower
14. Pool

Describe the area per Out of the Abyss (pp 12-16). Tailor the work assignment to the area.

Try to illustrate the cruelty and boredom of the drow and quaggoths. If a prisoner is left with spare time it is filled with some kind of cruel pointless task like stacking rocks, coiling ropes and organizing supplies. More times than not the work is cruelly undone and forced to start again.

Give the player’s the opportunity to gain information or acquire items to help their escape.

The quaggoths don’t really talk to the prisoners but the drow will if only to boast their superiority. This can be an opportunity for the characters to learn something from the list “What the drow know.”

Set the stage for Feeding Time by having one of the prisoners act up during work.

### Describe Feeding Time

>On your way back to your pen the drow stop you before the gate. They force all of you to stand on the edge of the cliff face.
>
>Silence overcomes everyone and nothing happens for what seems like minutes. You look out over the cavern before you. The thick webbing strung between the hanging towers quivers as you anticipate whatever the drow have in store for you.
>
>One by one you watch as giant spiders slowly climb the webbing gathering below you and wait.
>
>Another minute passes while you hear the drow slowly stalk behind you all. Suddenly out of the corner of your eye you see a body trip out over the edge and tumble down in a freefall until they are caught in the webs. It’s [prisoner who acted up]! The drow pushed them to feed their pet spiders.
>
>The screams don’t last long. They are quickly muffled beneath the frenzied bodies of the giant spiders at they bite, paralyzing their prey before wrapping it in web to slowly consume until their next meal is served.
>
>With that the drow coral you all into your pen. Wordless smirks pasted across each of their faces as they do so.

### Describe Bad Dreams

>After a day filled with hard labor, abuse, malnourishment and random death around you, your sleep is… troubled and fitful. Particularly for spellcasters.
>
>Dark shadows seem to move and reach out toward you as you wander lost through endless mazes of tunnels. Oily tentacles slide to brush against you while a great buzzing and howling rises in the distance. Infected wounds on the tentacles burst open in clouds of spores and crawling masses of maggots and insects.
>
>You wake in a cold sweat filled with a paranoia that something is out there in the dark depth – something far worse than the drow.

### Describe the Drow

What the drow know.

- It is a ?? day journey to Menzoberranzan
- The outpost is close to the Darklake
