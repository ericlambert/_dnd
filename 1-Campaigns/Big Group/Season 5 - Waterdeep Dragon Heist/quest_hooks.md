## Zardoz and The Soul Miners

**This quest hook provides a good opportunity to transition a campaign from any city on the Sword Coast to the adventure ***Out of the Abyss***.**

[pc] Naivara
[goal] Find her youngest sister
[bad news about goal]
>*... your young sister was never taken by the Soul Miners. The cult is long since dead!*
>
>*No, no… I’m afraid your mother has duped you. Like many Drowish Matrons, she saw in you, her eldest daughter, a rival for leadership. Your willingness to see the other side, your lack of zealotry for the will of Lolth and your love for the younger sister were all factors that your mother saw as weakness that would be the undoing of her House. I’m afraid, she sent you away on a wild goose chase.*

>*... Like many Drowish Matrons, she saw in you, her eldest daughter, a rival for leadership. Your willingness to see the other side, your lack of zealotry for the will of Lolth and your love for the younger sister were all factors that your mother saw as weakness that would be the undoing of her House.*

Jalester Silvermane of the Lords’ Alliance thinks that Zardoz Zord commander of the Sea Maidens Faire might have a lead into [goal].

>“I believe Zardoz Zord commander of the Sea Maiden’s Faire may know something about your sister’s whereabouts.
>
>I dropped [pc]'s family name in an unrelated conversation about the city of Luskan and a slight flash of recognition crossed his face. You might want to investigate by gaining access to his flagship, the Eyecatcher, anchored in Deepwater Harbor, a mile away from his other ships The Heartbreaker and the Hellraiser. Both of those ships are docked across from each other at the same pier in the Dock Ward.
>
>For some time Zardoz has been trying to persuade me to set up a meeting between him and Laeral the Open Lord. I feel like he intends to petition her support in bringing the city of Luskan into the Lords’ Alliance. I have convinced Laeral to meet but have not passed that along to him yet. Laeral will meet him in three days at her family crypt in the City of the Dead.
>
>If you do talk to him feel free to use that intel to your advantage.”

See page 132 of Waterdeep : Dragon Heist for details about Sea Maiden’s Faire and page 206 for details on Zardoz Zord (Jarlaxle)

Once the characters gain access to Zardoz, he quickly recognizes [pc] and teases knowledge of [goal].

If the characters ask about Zord’s interest in Luskan and the Lords’ Alliance he remarks:

>*Well we all know that Luskan has an…. unsavory reputation. That has thwarted all previous efforts, and the current leaders of the Lords' Alliance have voiced their opposition to Luskan's admittance. A few have flatly declared that the city will never be welcome in the alliance.*
>
>*Nonetheless we will persist to prove our place at the table. The city of Luskan has been a good home to us freaks and eccentrics in the Sea Maiden’s Faire. I aim to persuade Laeral (LAIR-awl) Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, to champion Luskan's cause even if that means losing other alliance members in the process.*

If a bargain for information is reached and the character’s have given Zardoz info he finds valuable, he reveals the following about [PC's goal]:

>*Oh my dear, [bad news about goal]!*
>
>*No, no… I’m afraid you've been duped. [more details about bad new] I’m afraid, you've been on a wild goose chase.*
>
>*How do I know this? Let’s just say, the Sea Maiden’s Faire gets around.*

As Zardoz says this, your vision becomes blurry. You try to stand but your legs don’t respond. You look to your companions and they all seem to be experiencing the same thing. The food! You’ve been poisoned! As darkness gathers a the edges of your vision you hear Zardoz again… but his voice seems distant now.

>*At any rate, I’m sorry to have to do this… I really am. But well I’m afraid I can’t allow you all to leave…*
>
>Through your blurry vision you can make out a wide smile across Zardoz’s face. A face that seems to be darkening in tone from a bronzed tan to deep almost purple onxy. As you pass out you hear Zardoz’s final statement echoing through your mind.
>
>*We have a journey to make together although I imagine you will all sleep through most of not all of it.*

The party wakes in The Slave Pen’s of the drow outpost Velkenvelve in the Underdark.

This begins the adventure Out of the Abyss. Refer to the Scene plan ***Out of the Abyss - Chapter 1: Prisoners of the Drow***

## Old Dad and the Sea

After a meeting with Naivara, Jalester visits with Riley as she works on a new batch of Trollskull Ale.

As they reminisce Jalester reveals that a few years back he learned that Riley’s father never went off to war.

“Riley, you should know something. I have reason to believe your father never actually went off to fight in the undead war. I believe that instead he left on a merchant ship that set sail for the Sea of Fallen Stars. I think your father is alive.

While researching properties in the Docks Ward that might have ties to the XG or the Zhentarim, I came across an old shipping manifest describing a merchant ship named The Undying Light that called the Sea of Fallen Stars home and had docked in Waterdeep about three years after your father disappeared. His name was listed among the crew.

I haven’t tracked the Undying Light any further however any merchant ship that has travelled to Sword Coast would be known to the seaside town of Saltmarsh just north of the Mere of Dead Men.”

This is a hook into the adventure Isle of the Abbey as described in the book Ghosts of Saltmarsh.

## Bad Druids!

Walking by the manor one morning is Yagra and Fala’s “tenant” Ziraj. The two of them seem to be talking seriously on their way to Fala’s shop. Nala notices this as she tends to and enjoy’s the yard around the Manor.

As an aside, Naivara also notices Ziraj walking with Yagra it occurs to her that knowledge of a connection between Yagra a known Zhent affiliate and the shady Ziraj might be the kind of thing that Jalester would pay well for either in treasure or in information trade.

A few minutes later Yagra, leaves the Corellon’s Crown and stops to catch up with Nala. Eventually Yagra offers something to Nala.

“So, I thought you might want to know that rumors have reached my employer that in the far northeast in the forest below Mount Hotenow the folk of town called Oakhurst have seen a mysterious circle of druids carrying in reverence an unhatched dragonborn egg. They think it may have something to do with the goblins that have long frequented the town once each spring selling a single apple that can cure any disease.”

This is a hook into the adventure “Sunless Citadel” found in Tales from the Yawning Portal.

## Steel and Wood

Embric and Avi of the Steam and Steel have been getting a cold reception from their neighbor “Tally” Fellbranch and don’t know why. It started after they made a business proposal to combine the efforts of the two shops. They ask the party to find out?

## Talking with the Genasi

The quest starts when the party either visits Steam and Steel or Embric and Avi visit the party at Trollskull Manor to welcome them to the neighborhood. As the genasi couple speak with the party, Avi eventually leads the conversation to Talisolvanar 'Tally' Fellbranch, the half-elf owner of the Bent Nail.

"Have you met Tally yet? The owner of the Bent Nail?" the blue skinned water genasi asks. Before you can answer, Embric rolls his eyes and says: "By Kossus' flame, why can't you just let it go?". Avi sends a teasing glare his partner's way. "Don't flare up now, darling. I'm just making conversation with our new friends." He turns back to you. "I'm just wondering what your impression is of him. We've been trying to get into business with him, but it seems..."

Once again, Embric interjects: "He doesn't like that we're together. Fine. We've faced ignorance before. It's nothing new - I won't waste any more of my time speaking of it!"

Embric storms off after this. After he has left, Avi explains.

“We invited Tally over for dinner a few weeks ago to discuss a business proposition: make products of steel and wood together, combining our efforts for the benefit of both shops.

The dinner started well, but as the night progressed, Tally seemed uncomfortable with Embric and me. In the end, he flatly rejected the offer and left before even finishing the exquisite Calishite chocolate cake Embric had made!

Tally has been cold and dismissive of us ever since. Embric says he doesn't care but I know his feelings are hurt but somehow I’m not sure Tally is actually a bigot. It feels more complicated than that.

If you happen to meet Tally as you get to know the neighbors would you mind helping me find out what offended him? If you learn anything that clears things up we would really appreciate it. If there's any way to make the half-elf reconsider our business proposition even better.”

## Talking with Tally

Tally can be found in his shop (T2), whittling away at a wooden cane. The middle-aged half-elf is friendly and courteous, but it'll take a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to get him to open up about the genasi.

On a successful check:
Tally puts down the cane he's working on and sighs heavily. "I know they think it's because I don't like them being together, but it's not that... Or, well, in a way it is. You see, I used to be married. Her name was Isolla. The most brilliant and beautiful woman I've ever met. But she was human. We had many great years together, but while I just greyed a bit at the temples, she grew old and eventually... It's been several years now, and I thought I had moved on. But, seeing the two of them together, so happy and so perfect for each other, just hurts too much. If we went into business together, I'd have to see that every day. I can't bear that. But how do you explain to someone that you can't be around them, because they're too happy? That's not fair either."

On a failed check:
“I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be rude but I don’t see how that is really any of your business. Now if you’ll excuse me we have a deadline to meet replacing some broken chairs and tables for The Yawning Portal. I really need to get back to work on that.
If you’re interested in buying anything just ring the bell and we’ll send someone out to help you.”

### Steel and Wood Resolved

Simply getting an explanation fulfills Avi's quest. He offers a 20% discount on the Steam and Steel's inventory.

But, the party might want to help solve the problem as well. If the characters have great ideas on their own, let them run with those.

Otherwise, you can have a character with proficiency in Religion remember that the Temple of Sune, the goddess of beauty and love, regularly holds sermons where widowers can meet, mourn and mingle, often resulting in new, beautiful unions. You can also have Avi come up with the idea, when the party explains what Tally told them.

With a little persuasion (a compelling argument like: "I think that Isolla would want you to move on and be happy" should suffice), Tally will agree to attend one such sermon.

You can put a sweet little bow on the whole ordeal by having Avi and Embric show up at the Manor with a smiling Tally and an elven woman a few weeks later - just to give thanks to the party before heading out for a couples' dinner!

## Paper Problems

**Location:** Party's neighborhood

Trollskull Alley is home to two magical shops: Corellon's Crown, where the wood elf Fala Lefaliir sells potions and remedies, and Book Wyrm’s Treasure, where Rishaal the Page Turner sells books and spellscrolls. The two have been at odds ever since Fala learned that Rishaal uses Duskwood paper for his scrolls which and started protesting Book Wyrm’s Treasures. According to Fala is a type of wood that is being over forested.

### Fala's Protest

This small quest starts either:

when the party visit’s Book Wyrm’s Treasure for the first time.
>As you approach Book Wyrm's Treasure you are first met by Fala holding up a sign that reads "Duskwood paper = Murder!" while ranting at anyone who walks past the Book Wyrm's Treasure.
>
>*Book Wyrm’s Treasure uses Duskwood for their spell scrolls! Did you know that a tenth of all Duskwood trees are chopped down each year? Soon there'll be none left!*

After the party's talks to Fala for a while, Rishaal comes out the shop and says...

>*Please don't let this charade scare you away. Come inside. I could use your help!"*

-or-

when the party visits Corellon’s Crown for the first time.

>In the corner of the room, leaned against the wall is a large handwritten sign that reads "Duskwood paper = Murder!".

When asked about the sign:
>Fala’s cheerful demeanor turns angry and an exaggerated frown crosses her face.
>
>*Book Wyrm’s Treasure uses Duskwood for their spell scrolls! Did you know that a tenth of all Duskwood trees are chopped down each year? Soon there'll be none left!*
>
>*Ever since I found this out I spend whatever time I can protesting in front of the shop until Rishaal gets the message and stops.*

While the party's talking to Fala, Rishaal comes out the shop and says...

>*Please don't let this charade scare you away. Come inside - I could use your help!.*

### Talking to Rishaal

If the characters come inside to speak with Rishaal, he laments the wood elf's protests:

"I understand the concerns about Duskwood, but I don't have other options. It's the only paper I can get that is of high enough quality. My customers expect no less from me.”

“Look, I’ll admit, I’m not big on environmental issues but Fala's protests are going too far and beginning to hurt my business. If you help make the protests stop, I'll let each of you pick out a book or scroll at half price!"

Changing Papers
The most obvious, non-violent way to make Fala's protest stop, is to find another sort of paper for Rishaal's scrolls.

If the party starts discussing this kind of a solution, ask characters proficient in Arcana to make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

On a successful check:
“You remember that there are some quality alternatives to Duskwood for scroll paper; Shadowtop, Laspar, Zalantar. However, suppliers are few and far between - and only other wizards are likely to know of one in the city.”

On a failed check:
“You’ve really only ever heard of Duskwood-based scrolls but you guess there might be alternatives. Maybe a powerful wizard would be able to help?”

Depending on who they've met or which factions they've joined, the party may already be aware of one of three notable wizards in Waterdeep: Skeemo Weirdbottle (Zhentarim), Remallia Haventree (Harpers) and Vajra Safahr (Force Grey).

If the players are stumped on how to proceed:

- Suggest that they think about anything on their character sheets that might help them come up with a plan. (Traits/Skills/Aspects of their Background/Backstory)
- Suggest (in-character as an NPC) that the party reach out to a friendly local they might know.
- You can also have a friendly NPC show up to hang out at Trollskull Manor. In chatting they might drop hints.
- As a last resort you can ask all characters to roll a DC 10 Intelligence check. Those who have spent significant time in Waterdeep or otherwise know the city well do so with Advantage. On a successful check: a character knows of one of the prominent wizards listed above.

### Meeting Skeemo

The party can meet Skeemo at his potion-shop 'Weirdbottle’s Concoctions'. The zhent deals mostly in potions, but does still buy shadowtop-paper for his personal use. He'll put Rishaal in contact with his supplier if Rishaal shares some of his more powerful spells with him. Rishaal is loathe to share magic with the disreputable Zhent, but will do it if the party recommends it.

### Meeting Remallia

Volo drops by Trollskull Manor to say hello. While chatting he mentions…

> “Mirt the Moneylender made an appearance at The Portal last night. Hadn’t seen him in a while. He, Threestrings and I were drinking with Lady Remallia Haventree’s son Arthius, who was heading back to Silverymoon this morning. Arthius was really impressed by his mother’s ever-growing knowledge of the Arcane. ‘Have you seen her latest warding on the manor? I don’t think I’ll ever catch up with her skill… don’t tell her though. He said. It was actually really sweet. As a kid he really resented her.”

If the party expresses interest in meeting Remallia, Volo points them to Threestrings.

> “Ah… well you might speak with Threestrings. Lady Haventree’s time is no doubt limited however Threestrings seems to have an in with her. Perhaps he could put in a word for you?”

Once a meeting is set up Remallia welcomes the party to her manor. She'll gladly share her laspar-supplier with Rishaal, but expects him to report to her if anyone buys powerful magic from his shop.

You might use this opportunity to have Remallia ask a favor of the party (see the table of Harpers Quests) before they leave and pass the terms of the deal back to Rishaal.

Rishaal is reluctant to agree to this, but of the three options this one is the most palpable to him.

### Meeting Vajra

During a conversation that the party has with Jalester Silvermane he might mention Vajra in passing.

As you approach Jalester you can overhear a bit of a conversation he is having.

>“I, for one, think it’s great. It’s about time a new generation has a bit of authority in this city. Vajra Safahr is obviously capable Force Grey is in good hands. Besides Khelban himself chose her to secede him as Blackstaff. She’ll make a great High Wizard and I’m excited to see what comes of Blackstaff Academy”.
>

If the party expresses interest in meeting Vajra, Jalester points them to Meloon.

>“You should really talk to Meloon Wardragon. He works with Force Grey and could probably set something up.”

#### Meeting Meloon

>Before you stands a very tall young man with broad shoulders, blond hair, and pale blond scruff on his face. His left forearm  carries a tattoo of the Wardragon family crest, a serpentine dragon wrapped vertically around a downward-pointing sword.
>
>*Hello! Hello! Meloon Wardragon. You’re all the crew that brought Renaer back to us all in one piece. Nice to meet ya’!*
>
>Meloon forcibly, yet friendlily shakes hands with each of you.
>

If asked about a meeting with Vajra Meloon is surprisingly easy going about it.

>*You want to meet the Blackstaff, eh?*
>
>Meloon pauses to shoot you a skeptical eye…

After an awkward beat…

>*Sure! I can probably set that up for ya! To be honest, I’m surprised she hasn’t reached out to you already.*

Once a meeting is established, Vajra speaks with the party inside the Blackstaff Tower. She'll put Rishaal in contact with her zalantar-supplier only if he promises he won't sell magic to known Xanathar Guild members.

You might use this opportunity to have Vajra ask a favor of the party (see the table of Force Grey Quests) before they leave and pass the terms of the deal back to Rishaal.

Rishall will reluctantly agree, although he'll miss the Xanathar's gold.

### Paper Problems Resolved

How much or how little the party is involved in the negotiations is up to them - maybe they'll just put Rishaal in contact with the other wizards, or maybe they'll get offers from each and broker a deal. Maybe they’ll find another creative solution.

The most important thing is that they meet the neighbors and perhaps other important NPCs.

If they manage to get Rishaal to switch papers, Fala stops the protest and is, like Rishaal, grateful for the party's aid, offering permanent or temporary discounts on their wares.

## A Lesson from Heaven

**Location:** Trollskull Manor

While an adventurer is passing under an awning within 10 feet of the Turret Peak (Area 19), a loose brick falls. The character must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, all while being reminded that masonry should be left to bona fide professionals.

The morning after your first night in the Manor you step out to walk the yard and sort of inspect it and the manor exterior more closely. As you do you hear the scraping of stone from above. You look up just in time to see a brick falling from the manor’s turret, crashing toward your head!

Make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

## A Harmless Prank

**Location:** Trollskull Manor

While an adventurer is busy in the basement, Lif plays a harmless prank by locking them in the basement, preferably while the others are off running errands across the city.

You have been spending the day cleaning up the basement of the Manor and have just called it a day. You climb the ladder and push on the hatch leading back to the Manor’s taproom. It won’t budge. Make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

On a successful Athletics check:
You push again with all your strength and the hatch fly’s open. But as you reach for the edge of the taproom floor, you then feel the ladder start trembling then begin to slide out from under you. Make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

On a successful Acrobatics check:
Just as the ladder falls below your feet you lead and catch the edge of the hatch. With a sigh of relief you pull yourself up, dust yourself off and as you look up you notice something on the floor in front of you.

A series of old dirty bar rags are arranged to spell “Last Call!”

On a failed Acrobatics check:
You freefall to the basement floor and take 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

On a failed Athletics check:
Ten minutes pass with you trying to the point of exhaustion to open the hatch. You climb back down the ladder to take a moments rest. Rats scurry and squeak in the darkness while you do. A few more minutes pass and you get up to try again at the hatch. The squeaking gets louder and seem to all come from a single dark corner of the basement. You look over and see a swarm of rats scurry and engulf your fee. As they climb your legs they bite!

Roll a Bite Attack for the swarm of rats.

Roll Initiative!
