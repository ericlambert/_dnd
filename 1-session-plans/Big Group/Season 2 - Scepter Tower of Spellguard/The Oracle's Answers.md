To Riley
“To the east I see a sky of stars falling to the sea.  In their fading light, a ship’s crew toils mindlessly into eternity.  A prison with no bars.  He weeps for you now, as he was once so near as to reach out and touch you, to hold you again. You are separated by but a heartbeat. But Beware, judgement often awaits those who seek the lost.  I see a wall of weeping on your path and a trail of blood in your wake.”

- The Oracle

To Victor
“For the bearer of light I see powerful beaks and rending flesh.  Screams fall on the darkness with a dull thud as butchered flesh is consumed and yet remains. Pain becomes an unending and far reaching reality.  He begs for mercy from the emptiness and is only answered by the breathless desperation of starving beasts.”

“The beast watches from afar.  His journey over. Peace his reward.  The blood and screams of martyrs are but fruits to be plucked and enjoyed in the eternal bliss of the mountain.”

“The archer endlessly wanders, seeking his lost comrades.  I hear a voice scream into the fog, “Victor! Victor!!, We must save Victor from the poison!!!” as hidden voices giggle and cast lots.  This is a directionless place.  Confusion and desperation are the currency here.”

“You hear your friends but I warn you not to seek them.  For saving them would mean losing yourself.  The sacrifice may be more than you can bear.”

To Maynard
The oracle snaps her fingers and produces a small locket which she promptly throws at Maynard’s feet. Inside the locket Maynard finds an old and tattered mugshot… of himself… as he appears now. On the back of the picture is a note.

To Elle
“I see two funerals."

"The first I see an aged elf maiden.  Her wrinkles are but windows into the depths of her knowledge.  Flowers and fragrant herbs adorn and surround her regal and lifeless body.  She lays atop the pyre as her pupils light the fire at once.  A cry of mourning as has never been heard rises from the high forest as elvish faces fall in pain and grief.  Those present fall to their knees, never to forget her.  Their cries rise above the flames and into the night but they soon dissipate as Faerun marches into eternity."

"In the second, a young elf begins her journey.  The black cart slowly drudges on behind black horses adorned in black dress.  Mourners crowd the streets and clamor for a view.  They gaze in disbelief before collapsing in hopeless grief at the site of her body.  Bahamut greets her greedily as songs are written of her and her beast companion.  She is remembered for eternity while the wood elves of the high forest are splintered and forgotten."

To Jamerius
"I see a great city to the south west where an aged mermaid blushes at each man who enters to take their fill.  Deep underground ogres grunt as casks reveal their valuable cargo.  As the wheat is separated from the chaff, your beloved are brought to the wood of the walking beasts.  Transformed soldiers of darkness, these will infest the realm and gallop into the night.  This inherent evil is your race’s lot.  Do you wish to save them? You also must be willing to join them."

To Sylmarwyn
"Very near now I see a young elven male.  Possessing of a secret told to no one, not even his own sister.  He hears the voices on the wind.  These 4 armed unflying anemones hear him as well, and they fear him!  They delight in his torture.  His subterranean screams feed them with magical delight.  A feast unknown to them in this time of twisted weave.  Their fury over the fall only sharpens their will to torture.  He does their bidding, a slave to their commands beneath the ruined City of Love.  Soon they will march on OolTuL to break the Sharn’s barrier.  It simply will not do to have “Aelar the nosey” foil their plans."
