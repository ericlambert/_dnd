## Daask Excavation site

> The lift seems to descend forever into the belly of Sharn. Several minutes pass as and the lift rattles and shakes, as if passing into some place it was not meant to go. This rumbling builds to a violent peak then the lift stops, and its doors open.

By the lift’s interior light, you can see into a vast, unlit cavern strewn with broken stonework from ancient buildings as far as you can see in every direction. The air is stale, and filled with dust and the scent of decay. These are the ruins of the cities atop which Sharn is built.

Ahead of you yawns a fifty-foot-diameter, ten-foot-deep pit that seems to have been intentionally dug. You hear the soft sobs of a young child coming from a wooden shed on the far side to the pit.

## Expanded description of the Daask Excavation site

### As they step out of the lift

> You find yourselves in a vast, eerie cavern, dimly lit by the interior light of the lift. The walls of the cavern are lined with broken stonework from long-abandoned buildings, and the air is thick with dust and the smell of decay. It's clear that this place has been forgotten for a very long time.

### As they make their way forward (undetected)

> As you make their way through the ruins, you catch glimpses of a group of goblins lurking in the shadows.
>
> You come upon a deep pit, fifty feet in diameter and ten feet deep. The edges of the pit are jagged and rough, as if it had been dug by hand rather than by machine. The sight of the pit raises many questions in your minds - why was it dug, and by whom?

> As you move closer, you see that the goblins appear to be watching a group of chained warforged who sit motionless in silence at the bottom of a shoallow pit. The warforged likely have been forced to dig by hand for hours and appear exhausted and in disrepair.
>
> The goblins seem to be keeping a close eye on the warforged, as if making sure that they don't try to escape or cause any trouble. They're clearly using the warforged as forced labor to excavate the site.

> You also hear the sound of a child's sobs, coming from a wooden shed on the far side of the pit. As you draw closer to the shed, the sobs grow louder and more desperate. You can hear the sound of someone whispering to the child, but they can't make out the words.

### They are ambushed

> You suddenly hear the sounds of scuffling and shuffling behind them. Whirling around, they see a group of goblins emerge from the shadows, armed and snarling with vicious intent.
>
> The goblins are fast and agile, darting in and out of the ruins with surprising ease. The adventurers struggle to keep up with their foes, and soon find themselves surrounded into a corner.
>
> With no escape route, you are are forced to stand and fight.
>
> Roll initiative.

### They ambush them


### If the party is losing

> Just when things seem darkest, a strange figure appears out of nowhere, wielding a strange, glowing sword. The figure dispatches the goblins with ease, moving with a grace and speed that's almost inhuman.

> Breathless and grateful, you turn to thank the figure. But they has already vanished, leaving behind only a faint trail of glowing light.

### After combat

> As you catch your breath, you realize that you're closer than ever to the shack and quiet sobs that come from it. But you also know now that danger could be lurking around any corner.

### The adventurers push open the door of the shed

> You push open the door of the shed revealing a small, cramped space filled with debris and broken furniture. Stale bread, smelly water, a pile of rags, and a chamber pot round out the accommodations. In the corner of the room, you see a small child, huddled in a ball and crying softly.  Covered in dust, the child is wearing the once-fine, now-ruined livery of a House Orien. The boy sobs, his face slack.

### The adventurers turn their attention to the child

> The child has clearly been traumatized by whatever he's experienced in this place, and needs to get him to safety.

With the child in tow, the adventurers make their way back to the lift...

> With the child in tow, you make your way back to the lift. As the lift climbs back to the streets of Sharn you can't help but wondering what other secrets this forgotten place might hold. You also know that you'll have to be careful in whatever you've gotten mixed up in.
