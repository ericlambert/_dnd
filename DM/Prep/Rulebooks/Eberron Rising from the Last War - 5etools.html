 an ancient ruin beneath the Demon Wastes, a band of heroes races to 
claim the Reaper's Heart. If the agents of the Emerald Claw reach it 
first, they'll reignite the Last War and unleash an army of undead.</i></p><p><i>In
 the city of Sharn, a team of spies pulls off an impossible 
scheme—breaking into the impenetrable vaults of House Kundarak. But 
instead of gold, they find a secret that could shatter the fragile peace
 between the nations.</i></p><p><i>Aboard an airship, a wizard debates 
the interpretation of an ancient prophecy with a blood-red dragon. If 
the sage loses the argument, the dragon will destroy the airship and 
everyone on it. But if she wins the debate, the dragon will take them to
 distant Argonnessen, and no human has ever seen the land of dragons and
 returned!</i></p><p>The world of Eberron has a rich history built on 
heroic deeds, evolving magic, and the wounds of a long, devastating war.
 Action, adventure, good, evil, and a thousand shades of gray paint the 
landscape in broad strokes. Ancient mysteries await discovery so they 
can influence the world and its people.</p><p>Magic is built into the 
very fabric of the world. It pervades everyday life. It provides 
comforts and conveniences unknown in either the modern world or any 
world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky 
prosper throughout the continent of Khorvaire, and a thriving 
aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world's economy 
thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare dragonmarks. 
Its people harness magic as a tool—to build cities, to sail ships 
through the skies, and to create both wonders and weapons.</p><p>Heroes 
come in all shapes and sizes, all classes and races. They travel the 
world, battling villains in instants of over-the-top action. And they 
unearth fabulous treasure, and deal with narrow escapes and ominous 
mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries of secrets as 
they are to threaten the world's safety.</p><p>Eberron embraces 
swashbuckling action and pulp adventure while adding a layer of noir 
intrigue. Stories don't always end well, and there isn't a perfect 
answer to every problem. The Last War turned old allies into bitter 
enemies and destroyed an entire nation, leaving behind terrible scars. 
Crime and corruption lurk in the great cities of Khorvaire. Hidden 
dragons shape the course of history, and sinister fiends influence the 
dreams of the unwary. Yet mortal greed and ambition might prove more 
dangerous than any dragon or fiend. This darkness affords opportunities 
for a group of bold adventurers to make a difference—for better or for 
worse.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="2" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Using This Book</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p4</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>This
 book is a gateway to using Eberron as a setting for your D&amp;D 
campaign. It guides players and the Dungeon Master through the process 
of creating characters and adventures set in this world.</p><p>This introduction presents an overview of the world: its history, its calendar, and the themes that drive it.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b>
 details how to create Eberron characters. It offers race options and a 
new class, the artificer, that reflect the flavor of the world. It also 
presents group patrons, a new concept that adds a shared purpose to your
 party of adventurers. You can use this material in Eberron or any other
 D&amp;D setting.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b> provides an overview of the 
nations of Khorvaire (and beyond) and the religions of Eberron, handy 
details whether you're a player seeking inspiration for your character's
 backstory or a DM looking for an intriguing place to set an adventure.</p><p><b>Chapter 3</b>
 focuses on Sharn, the City of Towers. Sharn is one of the wonders of 
Khorvaire, and a source of endless adventures. This chapter presents a 
host of interesting locations and activities you can explore in this 
towering metropolis.</p><p><b>Chapter 4</b> provides ideas for 
adventures in Sharn and beyond. It introduces sinister forces at work in
 the world, along with the impact of the Last War and the dreadful Day 
of Mourning. It also includes a short adventure you can use to launch 
your campaign in Sharn.</p><p><b>Chapter 5</b> includes magic items and other treasures for an Eberron campaign. It also explores the vital role of dragonshards.</p><p><b>Chapter 6</b>
 presents new monsters and NPCs drawn from the world of Eberron. From 
mighty archfiends to helpful homunculi, these creatures add challenges 
to your adventures in Eberron (or any other D&amp;D world).</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="3" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Seven Things to Know</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p4</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>What is Eberron? Here are the key things to know:</p><p><b>1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of</b>.
 The Last War plunged the continent of Khorvaire into civil war more 
than a century ago, shattering the Five Nations that made up the kingdom
 of Galifar. Just two years ago, the war ended with the signing of the 
Treaty of Thronehold and the establishment of twelve recognized nations 
and a tenuous peace. The conflicts, the anger, and the pain of the long 
war remain, however, and the new nations seek every advantage as they 
prepare for the next war to break out on the continent.</p><p><b>2. Dragonmarked Dynasties</b>.
 The great dragonmarked families are the barons of industry and commerce
 throughout Khorvaire and beyond. Their influence transcends political 
boundaries, and they remained mostly neutral during the Last War. Not 
technically citizens of any nation, the matriarchs and patriarchs of 
each house live in splendor within their enclaves and emporiums located 
throughout Khorvaire. These dynastic houses of commerce derive their 
power from dragonmarks—hereditary arcane sigils that manifest on certain
 individuals within the family, granting them limited but useful magical
 abilities associated with the trade guilds each family controls.</p><p><b>3. Lands of Intrigue</b>.
 The war is over, and the nations of Khorvaire now try to build a new 
age of peace and prosperity. Ancient threats linger, however, and the 
world needs heroes to take up the cause. Nations compete on many 
levels—over economic dominance, political influence, territory, magical 
power, and more—each looking to maintain or improve its status by any 
means short of all-out war. Dragonmarked houses, churches both pure and 
corrupt, crime lords, monster gangs, psionic spies, arcane universities,
 secret societies, sinister masterminds, dragons, and a multitude of 
organizations and factions join the struggle for position and power in 
the aftermath of the Last War.</p><p><b>4. A Continent of Adventure</b>.
 From the jungles of Q'barra to the blasted hills and valleys of the 
Demon Wastes, from the skyscrapers of Sharn to the dinosaur-filled 
Talenta Plains, Eberron is a world of adventure. Adventures can draw 
heroes from one exotic location to another across the continent of 
Khorvaire. The quest for the Mirror of the Seventh Moon might take the 
heroes from a hidden mountain shrine in Darguun to a ruined castle in 
the Shadow Marches and finally to a dungeon deep below the Library of 
Korranberg. Through the use of magical transportation, heroes can reach a
 wide range of environments over the course of an adventure, and thus 
deal with a diverse assortment of monsters and other challenges.</p><p><b>5. A World of Magic</b>.
 The technology of Eberron has developed not through the advance of 
science but by the mastery of magic. The widespread use of magic 
pervades life in the cities and towns. Airships and rail transport make 
rapid travel across the continent possible. A working class of minor 
mages, called magewrights, uses spells to provide energy and other 
necessities. Advances in magic item creation have led to everything from
 self-propelled farming implements to sentient, free-willed beings 
created in artificers' forges. With the aid of rare crystals called 
dragonshards, dragonmarks can be made more powerful, elementals can be 
controlled and harnessed, and magic items can be crafted and shaped.</p><p><b>6. New Races</b>. In addition to the common player character races found in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>, players can choose to play orc or goblinoid characters in Eberron. Or they can choose one of four new races: <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#changeling_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="changeling_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">changelings</a>, <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#kalashtar_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="kalashtar_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">kalashtar</a>, <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#shifter_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="shifter_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">shifters</a>, and <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#warforged_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="warforged_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">warforged</a>.
 Changelings have minor shapechanging abilities similar to those of 
doppelgangers. Kalashtar are planar entities merged with human hosts, 
giving them telepathic abilities. Shifters developed from the mixing of 
humans and lycanthropes, a union that grants them limited bestial 
abilities and feral instincts. The warforged are a constructed race 
created during the Last War, seeking to find its place in a post-war 
world.</p><p><b>7. D&amp;D with a Twist</b>. Every race, monster, spell, and magic item in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>, <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>, and <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#MM">Monster Manual</a>
 has a place somewhere in Eberron, but it might not be the place you 
expect. Eberron has a unique spot in the D&amp;D multiverse, and many 
familiar elements of the game play different roles in the world. In 
particular, mortal creatures are products of culture and circumstances, 
rather than the direct influence of the gods. As a result, you can't 
assume that a gold dragon is good or a beholder is evil; only in the 
case of celestials, fiends, and certain other creatures whose identity 
and worldview are shaped by magic (such as the curse of lycanthropy) is 
alignment a given.</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="4" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">History of Eberron</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p5</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Every
 child knows the story of the Progenitor Dragons: Siberys, Eberron, and 
Khyber. In the dawn of time, these three cosmic beings created thirteen 
planes of existence, each embodying a concept. Their final work was the 
Material Plane, where all ideas would become manifest: a realm that 
could know war and peace, life and death, order and chaos. But cruel 
Khyber sought ultimate dominion over this new reality. She struck 
Siberys without warning and tore him apart. Eberron wrestled with Khyber
 and bound the traitor in her coils but could not defeat her. So Eberron
 became a living prison, a world that would forever contain Khyber's 
evil.</p><p>Almost every culture in the world shares this story as a 
myth that explains the world. Shattered Siberys became the ring of 
golden dragonshards wrapped around the planet, said to be the source of 
magic. Eberron is the world, the source of all natural life. And Khyber 
is the Underdark and the source of aberrations and fiends, forever 
struggling against her bonds and yearning to destroy the world above.</p><p>Another
 tale shared across cultures describes one more conflict that occurred 
in the first age of the world. Long ago, powerful archfiends known as 
the Overlords and their armies of rakshasa and lesser fiends dominated 
Eberron. Forces of light—some versions of the story say the nine gods of
 the Sovereign Host, others say an alliance of dragons and 
celestials—eventually defeated the Overlords. But these fiends couldn't 
be destroyed; instead, their immortal essences were bound in Khyber. 
Whatever the true details of this tale, this much is true: if the 
Overlords ever break their bonds, the consequences would be 
catastrophic.</p><p>Over the course of millennia, numerous civilizations
 rose only to fall. Giants built mighty kingdoms on the continent of 
Xen'drik that were devastated by a war with the dragons of Argonnessen. 
The goblin empire of Dhakaan ruled Khorvaire until its reign was 
shattered by an invading army of mind flayers, beholders, and the foul 
creatures that created them. Today these civilizations are known only 
through the remnants left behind.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="5" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Five Nations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p6</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which 
covered most of the continent of Khorvaire. The Five Nations—Aundair, 
Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. 
Although each has a unique cultural identity, they share this unified 
foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations; the rulers of 
the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of 
Galifar. Despite their differences, an Aundairian has more in common 
with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.</p><p>A century
 ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became 
separate countries at odds with their neighbors. The Last War came to an
 end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The 
Five Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new 
nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold. The remaining Five 
Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="6" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Treaty of Thronehold</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p6</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 Treaty of Thronehold officially ended the Last War. The treaty 
recognized the following nations as sovereign states: Aundair, Breland, 
Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the 
Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. 
These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain diplomatic 
relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified 
government. Droaam has declared itself a nation but has yet to be 
recognized by the treaty nations.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="7" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Life in Khorvaire</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p6</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Although
 Eberron is a vast world with many continents and cultures, your 
adventures begin in the land of Khorvaire. Here are a few details about 
everyday life there.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="8" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Languages</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p6</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in 
Breland might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds
 might. The historical development of languages and cultures also 
explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the 
Orc language is written using the Goblin script (rather than Dwarvish, 
as stated in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>), because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins.</p><p>Common
 is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in 
Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of
 the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in 
Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc 
language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and 
Orc is an exotic language (see the Exotic Languages of Eberron table). 
Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade 
language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends. Infernal is 
sometimes called "Khyber's Speech," while Celestial is "the tongue of 
Siberys."</p><p>With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language 
granted by your race for a different language from the Standard 
Languages of Eberron table. If your halfling was raised in the Mror 
Holds, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that 
background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or 
NPC. An ogre from Droaam likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="9">Standard Languages of Eberron</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2" data-rd-isroller="false">Language</th><th class="col-8" data-rd-isroller="false">Main Speakers</th><th class="col-2" data-rd-isroller="false">Script</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-2">Common</td><td class="col-8">The Five Nations, trade language of Khorvaire</td><td class="col-2">Common</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Dwarvish</td><td class="col-8">Mror Holds</td><td class="col-2">Dwarvish</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Elvish</td><td class="col-8">Aerenal, Valenar</td><td class="col-2">Elvish</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Giant</td><td class="col-8">Inhabitants of Xen'drik</td><td class="col-2">Giant</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Gnomish</td><td class="col-8">Zilargo</td><td class="col-2">Dwarvish</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Goblin</td><td class="col-8">Darguun, Droaam, Shadow Marches, monsters of Khorvaire</td><td class="col-2">Goblin</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Halfling</td><td class="col-8">Talenta Plains</td><td class="col-2">Common</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Riedran</td><td class="col-8">People of Sarlona</td><td class="col-2">Common</td></tr></tbody></table><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="10">Exotic Languages of Eberron</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2" data-rd-isroller="false">Language</th><th class="col-8" data-rd-isroller="false">Main Speakers</th><th class="col-2" data-rd-isroller="false">Script</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-2">Celestial</td><td class="col-8">Celestials</td><td class="col-2">Celestial</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Daelkyr</td><td class="col-8">Aberrations, denizens of Khyber</td><td class="col-2">Daelkyr</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Draconic</td><td class="col-8">Dragons, dragonborn</td><td class="col-2">Draconic</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Infernal</td><td class="col-8">Fiends</td><td class="col-2">Infernal</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Orc</td><td class="col-8">Isolated orc tribes</td><td class="col-2">Goblin</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Primordial</td><td class="col-8">Elementals</td><td class="col-2">Primordial</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Quori</td><td class="col-8">Inspired, kalashtar, quori</td><td class="col-2">Quori</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">Sylvan</td><td class="col-8">Fey creatures</td><td class="col-2">Elvish</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="11" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Names and Surnames</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p6</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 naming conventions among the people of Khorvaire tend to follow 
language, rather than being linked to race. A Brelish dwarf who doesn't 
speak Dwarvish might also carry a name with a human origin rather than a
 traditional Dwarvish name.</p><p>Most citizens of Khorvaire have a 
given name followed by a surname. A surname associated with the Common 
language is usually either a family name or related to an occupation or 
region of origin. So Sorn Fellhorn, Kara of Windshire, and Tellan 
Magewright are all names you might find among the common folk.</p><p>The
 noble families of Galifar—along with those granted land and titles by 
one of the sovereigns of the Five Nations—add the prefix ir' to their 
surname. The name Darro ir'Lain tells you that this individual is a 
landed noble. The Wynarns were the royal line of Galifar, and the 
current rulers of Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath are all heirs of the 
Wynarn bloodline. Thus, Queen Aurala of Aundair is Aurala ir'Wynarn.</p><p>Another
 common prefix is d', used by any heir of a dragonmarked house who has 
manifested a dragonmark. So Merrix d'Cannith is a member of House 
Cannith who has manifested the Mark of Making.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="12" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Calendar</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p7</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 the common calendar of Khorvaire, days are 24 hours long, divided into 
day and night. Seven days make up a week, four weeks a month, and twelve
 months a year. The months correspond to the twelve moons of Eberron 
(see the Eberron Months table), and the prominent moon carries the name 
of the month in which its orbit brings it closest to the planet.</p><p>The seven days of the week, in order, are Sul, Mol, Zol, Wir, Zor, Far, Sar.</p><p>The
 common calendar of Khorvaire tracks the years since the founding of the
 kingdom of Galifar, using the abbreviation YK. The last king of 
Galifar, Jarot ir'Wynarn, died on 12 Therendor 894 YK. The Day of 
Mourning occurred a century later, on 20 Olarune 994 YK. By default, a 
new Eberron campaign begins on 1 Zarantyr 998 YK.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="13">Eberron Months</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2" data-rd-isroller="false">Month</th><th class="col-10" data-rd-isroller="false">Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-2">1</td><td class="col-10">Zarantyr (mid-winter)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">2</td><td class="col-10">Olarune (late winter)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">3</td><td class="col-10">Therendor (early spring)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">4</td><td class="col-10">Eyre (mid-spring)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">5</td><td class="col-10">Dravago (late spring)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">6</td><td class="col-10">Nymm (early summer)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">7</td><td class="col-10">Lharvion (mid-summer)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">8</td><td class="col-10">Barrakas (late summer)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">9</td><td class="col-10">Rhaan (early autumn)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">10</td><td class="col-10">Sypheros (mid-autumn)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">11</td><td class="col-10">Aryth (late autumn)</td></tr><tr><td class="col-2">12</td><td class="col-10">Vult (early winter)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="14" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Currency</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p7</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Merchants
 and nobles use letters of credit to handle large transactions, drawing 
on the reserves of the dwarven banks of the Mror Holds. But most 
day-to-day transactions use coins of precious metal. With the collapse 
of the kingdom of Galifar, each of the Five Nations began to mint its 
own currency, along with the Mror bankers. However, while the designs 
imprinted on these coins vary based on the source, each of these 
factions has continued to use the same metals, weights, and 
denominations set forth in the days of Galifar, maintaining a simple 
standard for commerce across Khorvaire.</p><p>The copper crown (cp) 
traditionally depicts the crown of Galifar on one face. The crown is the
 lowest denomination of coin minted under the rule of Galifar, which 
spawned the saying, "In Galifar, even the beggars have crowns."</p><p>The
 silver sovereign (sp) bears the face of a living or recent ruler. An 
unskilled laborer can expect to earn a sovereign for a day's work.</p><p>The gold galifar (gp) bears the image of Galifar I, the founder of the old kingdom.</p><p>The
 platinum dragon (pp) bears the image of one of the dragons of legend. 
With a value of one hundred sovereigns, these coins are used only by the
 wealthiest citizens of Khorvaire, and the average peasant might never 
see such a coin.</p><p>A number of other coins remain in circulation, 
such as the double crown of Breland (2 cp) and the silver throne of Cyre
 (5 sp). However, all the major nations of Khorvaire make use of the 
four basic coins described above.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="15" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Pulp Adventure</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p7</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Eberron

tensions of war remain. From the fanatics of the Emerald Claw and the 
mad cults of the Dragon Below to the flesh-warping daelkyr and ancient 
archfiends, Eberron faces many threats, and few people besides the 
player characters are able to stop them. The gods are distant and don't 
directly intervene. The Silver Flame is a divine force of light, but it 
can act only through mortal champions. The few powerful benevolent NPCs 
have limitations: the Keeper of the Flame loses her powers if she leaves
 her citadel. The Great Druid, the spiritual leader of the Eldeen 
Reaches, is a tree. Most of the powerful people in the world focus on 
selfish goals. If an angry dragon attacks Sharn, there's no one else to 
deal with the problem: the fate of the city is in your hands.</p><p>Consider
 a dynamic backstory when developing your character and choosing your 
background, whether you take a background from the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a> or the house agent background in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,1">chapter 1</a>
 of this book. If you take the soldier background, you might have played
 a role in events of the last few years. What did you do during the Last
 War? What was your greatest triumph or defeat? If you're a spy, are you
 a prized agent or did you disavow your organization after they pushed 
you too far? Don't think of your character as a set of numbers: even at 
1st level, you're remarkable in Eberron.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="18" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">DM Tip: High Stakes</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p7</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>What's
 better than a battle on the deck of an airship? A battle on the deck of
 an airship that's about to crash! A DM should look for ways to raise 
the stakes of an Eberron scene, so players feel that every decision 
matters. This could be driven by the consequences of failure: your 
actions protect your friends, your house, or your nation. It could 
involve time: the alarm's been triggered, and you only have 6 rounds 
before security arrives. Such things can even be incidental. Did you 
start a fight in an alley behind a bar? Now you notice the drunk ogre 
sleeping in the shadows. If she wakes up, this could get ugly.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="19" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Remarkable Villains</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p8</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Eberron

of pulp adventure includes recurring villains who closely match the 
heroes—rivals who advance in power as you do.</p><p>To create a compelling villain, the DM and players might develop a villain's backstory together. A DM might ask a player: <i>When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?</i>
 Likewise, when a pulp villain appears to die, they can devise 
remarkable escapes from death. Perhaps Halas had a ring that cast an 
illusion of his death while stabilizing him or cast <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#feather%20fall_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="feather%20fall_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">feather fall</a> when he leapt from that tower in Sharn. A DM could engage the players in determining the answer: <i>It's Halas Martain, all right. How do you think he survived your last encounter?</i> This collaboration can produce a compelling story and a sense of investment in the world.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="20" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Noir Intrigue</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p8</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Eberron

 characters are remarkable people, but they aren't perfect. As you 
consider a flaw for your character, you can add a little hard-boiled 
flavor by considering the past: Did you make a tragic mistake, and if 
so, is it something you can ever undo? Did you hurt or betray someone 
who now seeks revenge? The Regrets table provides a few examples of

 regret helps shape your personality as an element of your past that 
plays an ongoing role in your story. But perhaps you have a problem that
 needs to be resolved right now. Another way to define a character's 
flaw is to roll on the Debts table.</p><p>Why would you want to take on a
 debt? The obligation adds depth to a character and provides a 
compelling, immediate motive for adventuring—you're not just out to get 
rich; you need gold to get that bounty off your head. It's also an 
opportunity to establish an element that can be part of a character 
moving forward. If you're trying to reclaim a magic item from a 
pawnshop, you declare that your character once owned that magic item—an 
heirloom, something you created, or a gift from a mentor—you've just 
temporarily lost it. If you're trying to raise money to join a secret 
society, it suggests that membership in this organization may be a part 
of the story later on.</p><p>Establishing a debt requires collaboration 
and approval by both player and DM. Work together to develop the 
details: Who's blackmailing you? Which secret society are you trying to 
join? What's the story behind the magic item you've pawned, and what 
sort of item is it? You can present ideas, but the DM has final 
approval.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="24">Debts</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 every conflict involves a fight between light and darkness. The vast 
majority of people are driven by simple motives: greed, fear, pride, or 
ambition. One person just wants to get some gold in their pocket. 
Another wants to impress a paramour. A leader guiding their nation into 
war is motivated both by fear of their neighbors and the sincere belief 
that Khorvaire would be better off under their rule.</p><p>Primordial 
forces strive to change or destroy Eberron. But more often, characters 
encounter misguided patriots, religious extremists, dragonmarked houses 
looking to wring a few more pieces of gold out of Khorvaire, spies who 
will do anything to protect their nations, and petty criminals trying to
 build empires. Eberron holds a place for selfless heroes and truly vile
 villains, as well as everyone in between.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="26" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Shades of Gray</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p9</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 Eberron, it's not always easy to separate the heroes from the villains.
 Good people can do terrible things, while cruel or heartless people 
might serve the greater good. An inquisitor might torture innocents in a
 quest to root out a cult of the Dragon Below; if she's stopped, the 
cult will survive and flourish. A group of orcs periodically raids a 
human settlement because the settlers built their village on land sacred
 to the orcs and are disrupting wards that hold evil at bay. The heroes 
find a powerful magic weapon in a tomb, but the artifact is the sword of
 an ancient hobgoblin general, whose descendants want it back. The ways 
to resolve these problems aren't always simple.</p><p>Certain situations
 demand straightforward decisions. If Emerald Claw cultists are about to
 detonate a necrotic resonator that will kill half of Sharn, they need 
to be stopped. But in a good Eberron story, the simplest solution may 
not be the best one.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="27" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Something to Lose</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p9</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 a noir story, things don't necessarily end well. But any adventure 
carries a risk of death or failure, so what additional factors might be 
at risk for the characters? They should have something to lose beyond 
hit points, vulnerabilities not reflected in game statistics: fear of a 
tarnished reputation, a threat to a friend or lover, a favorite business
 destroyed or taken over. Character relationships require players to 
invest in the story and work best when the DM and player collaborate to 
develop details (the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4">group patrons</a> in chapter 1 provide a framework for fleshing out such details).</p><p>A
 DM who introduces an old buddy who served with the player characters 
during the war could describe the person and then ask each player to 
define a connection to them. Present each player with a prompt: <i>Player one, how did Smitty save your life? Player two, you and Smitty were both in a prison camp; how did you escape?</i>
 The answers to these questions provide details to use in a campaign, 
and they give the players a personal investment, which makes it more 
significant when the Emerald Claw targets Smitty for assassination!</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="28" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">A Magical World</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p10</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 part of everyday life, but citizens harness lesser effects and use them

central nations of Khorvaire. Travelers can always make their way by 
horse or coach, which might employ draft animals magebred by House 
Vadalis for speed or endurance. House Vadalis also supplies exotic 
mounts such as hippogriffs and griffons. Elemental galleons use bound 
air or water elementals to propel them.</p><p>Two main options provide 
long-distance travel across land. Major cities in Khorvaire are linked 
by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows you to avoid the 
perils—and tedium—of the roads. The lightning rail uses bound elementals
 to pull a train of carriages over a path of magical stones, between 
which a rail-like stream of lightning arcs.</p><p>If speed is an issue, 
you can book passage on a House Lyrandar airship, which uses a bound 
elemental to hold a ship aloft and propel it through the air. This is 
almost the fastest way to travel, but also the most expensive. Elemental
 airships are a recent innovation and are relatively rare; many cities 
don't yet have docking towers.</p><p>For those with no time to spare and
 plenty of money to spend, House Orien also has teleportation circles in
 each of its enclaves in cities across Khorvaire. At significant cost, a
 member of the house will transport passengers instantaneously from one

		</div></div><p></p><p>For hundreds of years, the continent of 
Khorvaire was united under the kingdom of Galifar. This peace came to an
 end with the death of King Jarot in 894 YK, just over a century ago. 
Conflict over the succession spiraled into outright war between the Five
 Nations.</p><p>The Last War was a bitter struggle that forever changed 
the shape of Khorvaire. It was a century marked by shifting alliances, 
with years of stalemate interspersed with periods of intense battles. 
This grueling conflict left deep scars on the land and the people, but 
there was worse to come. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre was 
consumed in a magical cataclysm now known as the Mourning. The cause of 
the Mourning remains unknown; many fear it was caused by unbridled use 
of war magic. Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating 
table, and the Last War came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of 
Thronehold.</p><p>Although many celebrated the end of the war, others 
remain unsatisfied with its outcome. No one won the war. Even though 
people optimistically refer to it as the Last War, most believe that 
it's only a matter of time until conflict begins anew. The mystery of 
the Mourning is the only thing holding the warmongers at bay. If someone
 uncovers the secret of the Mourning—if it can be proven that the 
Mourning can't happen again, or if its power could be harnessed as a 
weapon—war could erupt again. Until then, the nations remain in a cold 
war as each makes preparations and seeks advantages in a conflict that 
could lie ahead.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="40" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Scars of War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p12</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As
 of 1 Zarantyr 998 YK, it's been less than four years since the Mourning
 and less than two years since the Last War came to an end. The Last War
 spanned the continent and lasted for over a century. Most people want 
to move on. But the scars of decades of war can't be erased so quickly. 
These are just a few of the ongoing effects of the Last War.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="41" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dragonmarked Power</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p12</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 dragonmarked houses remained neutral in the war and made considerable 
profit selling their services to all sides. War drives innovation; House
 Cannith developed many new weapons during the war, including the 
warforged. House Lyrandar perfected its airships in the last decade of 
the conflict. Rumors persist of monsters or super soldiers developed by 
House Vadalis or biological weapons in the hands of House Jorasco.</p><p>The
 dragonmarked houses emerged from the war stronger than ever, with the 
divided nations dependent on their services. Before the Last War, united
 Galifar imposed many restrictions on the houses. Today, no monarch can 
afford to break ties with any of the dragonmarked houses. What will 
happen if one of the houses goes too far in its pursuit of profit?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="42" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">New Nations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p12</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Before
 the Last War, Galifar laid claim to all Khorvaire. Several new states 
emerged over the course of the war. In some cases, this was largely a 
formality; Galifar never had a strong grip on the Lhazaar Principalities
 or the gnome nation of Zilargo, and they held the Demon Wastes in name 
only. Other states were born in violence: the elves of Valenar and the 
goblins of Darguun seized their realms by force. But Aundair yearns to 
reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, Breland keeps a wary eye on the monstrous 
kingdom of Droaam, and many mistrust the Valenar elves. Within the Five 
Nations, anger remains over how the final lines were drawn; for example,
 Thrane retains control of the ancient Aundairian city of Thaliost, 
seized during the war.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="43" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Physical Damage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p13</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 borders between nations demonstrate the impact of generations of 
conflict. Forests and farmlands scorched by fire and magic are still 
recovering. Ruined cities have yet to be reclaimed, along with shattered
 villages and abandoned fortresses. These deserted sites now provide 
shelter for brigands or are haunted by the restless spirits of those who
 died in anguish.</p><p>This damage reached far beyond the front lines. 
Magic-fueled weapons, aerial cavalry, and guerrilla forces all struck 
deep within enemy territory, and the cities of Khorvaire suffered. 
Wherever you go, you might see the scorch marks of fireballs or wreckage
 from siege weapons. Every nation is working to repair these wounds, but
 the damage could linger for generations.</p><p>As you create an Eberron
 character, consider your roots and the impact of the war. Was your 
hometown destroyed in the war? Is your family thriving, or were its 
members scattered or slain during the conflict?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="44" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Refugees and Shortages</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p13</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Refugees
 live in every major city, including tens of thousands of exiles 
produced by Cyre's destruction. Cyrans are a people without a homeland, 
seeking shelter and sustenance in the lands of their former enemies. 
Many Cyran refugees are former soldiers who were fighting in enemy 
territory when the Mourning struck, or they were farmers and merchants 
who escaped before their nation was consumed. Former nobles now have 
nothing but rags, and scholars or artists live in alleyways.</p><p>Cities
 and towns still suffer from shortages in the aftermath of the war. 
Farmlands, workers, and the resources devoted to the war were lost. 
Nations are recovering, and most essential services and goods are 
available in major cities. But there is always the possibility that 
something you want—a luxury item or a spell component—simply isn't 
available or can be acquired only through the black market.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="45" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mourning</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p13</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 nation of Cyre was once the heart of the kingdom of Galifar. The Last 
War took a heavy toll on Cyre and its citizens, as the nation became a 
primary battleground where the Five Nations crossed swords. But no one 
was prepared for the disaster that struck in 994 YK.</p><p>Accounts of 
the Mourning vary. Some say that a blinding light engulfed the 
battlefield near the Saerun Road. Others say that dead-gray mists rose 
in the capital city of Metrol and spread from there. Within the space of
 one day, the nation of Cyre had been engulfed in a wall of mist, and 
anything caught within the mists was horrifically transformed. Over a 
million Cyrans were killed on the day of Mourning. Those who survived 
were soldiers fighting in enemy territory, those living on the borders 
who were able to flee from the advancing mists, and those few who were 
able to escape the interior through magical means. On 20 Olarune 994 YK,
 the nation of Cyre ceased to exist.</p><p>The Mourning threw Khorvaire 
into a state of shock. Who could unleash such power? Was this a weapon, 
and if so, when would those responsible issues their demands? Were the 
borders of the lingering walls of mist stable, or could they expand at 
any moment? What was to be done with the Cyran refugees surging into 
every adjacent nation? Fear of the Mourning ended the war. But all those
 questions remain unanswered.</p><p>Breland opened its borders to 
refugees, and Prince Oargev serves as de facto ruler in the area now 
called New Cyre. Despite its grand name, New Cyre is little more than a 
vast refugee camp. Other refugees scattered across Khorvaire; some are 
treated with pity, others with suspicion or anger. And fear of the 
Mourning hangs like a shadow across Khorvaire. Could it happen again? Is
 this how the world ends?</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="46" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mournland</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 wall of dead-gray mist surrounds the remnants of Cyre. Beyond the mists
 lies a land twisted by magic, a wound that will not heal. The blasted 
land is strangely transformed. In some places, the ground has fused into
 jagged glass. In others, it is cracked and burned. Broken bodies of 
soldiers from various sides litter the landscape—soldiers whose dead 
bodies refuse to decompose. The Mournland is a vast open grave.</p><p>In
 that horrific landscape, vile magical effects linger, and monsters 
mutate into even more foul and horrible creatures. Magical effects 
continue to rain upon the land as storms that never dissipate. Stories 
speak of living spells—war magic that has taken physical form, sentient 
fireballs and vile cloudkills that endlessly search for new victims. And
 angry ghosts continue to fight their final battles.</p><p>The only 
thing predictable about the Mournland is that nothing is predictable; 
any sort of monster or horror could lurk within its borders. And yet it 
also holds the wealth and treasures of an entire nation, along with the 
secrets of House Cannith and everything else that was left behind. It's 
dangerous. It's mysterious. But it's also a dungeon the size of a 
nation, with opportunities for those brave enough to enter the mists.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="47" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mourning and You</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>In
 making an Eberron character, think about the impact the Mourning had on
 you. If you're from Cyre, did you lose all your family and friends? Are
 there heirlooms lost in the mists that you're determined to regain, or 
loved ones you hope to someday see again? Do you feel loyalty to your 
nation and hope to see it restored, or have you burned Cyre out of your 
heart?</p><p>Even if you're not from Cyre, the Mourning may have had a 
profound impact on you. Are you afraid that the Mourning could consume 
all of Khorvaire, or do you prefer not to dwell on such things? If 
you're religious, did the shocking tragedy of the Mourning cause you to 
question your faith, or did it reinforce it? If you're an artificer or a
 wizard, are you interested in studying its effects more closely. Might 
you even hope to unravel its mysteries yourself? Do you see it solely as
 a tragedy, or do you hope that this awesome power could somehow be 
harnessed?</p><p>Perhaps you were caught in the Mourning and survived 
the experience, but its effects remain with you. Consider the following 
aftereffects of your experience:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">As
 a barbarian, you could have been a simple peasant caught in the 
Mourning. Everyone else in your community was killed, but their spirits 
were bound to you. Your barbarian rage represents you channeling these 
vengeful ghosts. Is there a way to lay these spirits to rest? Do they 
have unfinished business they want you to resolve?</li><li class="rd__li ">As
 a sorcerer, your magical powers could be the result of your exposure to
 the Mourning. Were you physically transformed as well, or are your 
powers the only manifestation of the Mourning? Are you comfortable using
 your abilities, or are you afraid that you might be increasing the 
power of the Mourning with each spell you cast?</li><li class="rd__li ">As
 a warlock, your patron could be interested in the Mourning and drive 
you to learn more about it. Your patron could even be part of the 
Mourning—perhaps a collective of spirits killed on the Day of Mourning, 
or a dark and enigmatic power that might have been responsible for this 
tragedy. If you take the latter approach, do you feel that by using your
 warlock magic you are serving the Mourning? Or do you believe that you 
siphon power from it and weaken it with your actions?</li><li class="rd__li ">As
 a member of an unusual race, you could say that you are actually a 
creation of the Mourning. Perhaps your dragonborn was an actual dragon 
transformed on the day of Mourning. Or maybe your tiefling is touched by
 the dark power of the Mourning instead of by an infernal power.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="48" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">What Caused the Mourning?</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p14</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 DM running an Eberron campaign can decide the cause of the Mourning or 
leave it as a mystery that will never be solved. People in Eberron have 
many theories about the cause of the Mourning. It's up to the DM to 
decide if any of them are correct:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The
 Mourning was the result of a century of extensive use of war magic. If 
the nations continue to use this magic, the Mourning will expand.</li><li class="rd__li ">The
 dragonmarked House Cannith made a fortune selling magical weapons to 
all sides during the Last War. The Mourning was caused by research gone 
horribly awry. The secrets can be found in a Cannith research facility 
within the Mournland. If this knowledge could be recovered and refined, 
it could produce a terrifying weapon.</li><li class="rd__li ">The 
Mourning was triggered by the release of an ancient demon overlord 
trapped since the dawn of time. This mighty fiend is lurking in the 
Mournland and building its power, but soon it will be ready to act.</li></ul><p>A
 DM should consider whether the mystery of the Mourning can be solved 
and what the consequences would be. Right now, fear of the Mourning 
holds war at bay. If it's confirmed that the Mourning is no longer a 
threat—or if one nation manages to harness its power—war could begin 
again.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="49" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Draconic Prophecy</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p15</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

lie in the conjunctions of the planes and moons, in strange symbols 
formed by the flowing lava of a volcanic eruption or the fissures caused
 by an earthquake. Carved in the walls of ancient citadels and on 
primeval megaliths, knot patterns appear to have meaning that only the 
contemplative mind can hope to comprehend. To those who can read them, 
these myriad events and signs form a map of possible futures, a map that
 can be used to shape the course of history.</p><p>Scholars call this 
map the Draconic Prophecy, attributing it to the Progenitor Dragons: 
Eberron, Siberys, and Khyber. The Prophecy is vast and complex, its 
signs scattered across the world. Few humans or even elves have the time
 or resources to unravel its secrets. The foremost students of the 
Prophecy are ancient dragons, immortal fiends, and others who have 
devoted thousands of years to this work.</p><p>What makes the Prophecy 
especially complex is that it doesn't define a singular path for the 
future. Rather, the Prophecy is a map that shows many possible futures, 
along with the steps that must occur to make that future a reality. A 
fragment of the Prophecy might say, "If the Bear King is slain by a 
sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall 
from his nation." The "Bear King" could refer to King Boranel of 
Breland, since the bear is Breland's heraldic beast. The "Shadow of the 
Mourning" could mean that Boranel must be slain in the Mournland, or it 
could mean that the assassination must occur on the anniversary of the 
Mourning. This passage doesn't say that Boranel will be assassinated or 
that the Brelish monarchy will fall; it suggests that if Boranel is 
assassinated under these conditions, then the monarchy will surely fall.
 But it could also be fulfilled in different ways, if the terms of the 
Prophecy are interpreted differently. Other fragments of the Prophecy 
might cover what happens if Boranel is assassinated under other 
circumstances, or what happens if he dies of natural causes.</p><p>As an
 adventurer, you could be hired by a scholar trying to piece together a 
fragment of the Prophecy and clash with a secret society along the way. 
Or you could discover that your family plays a pivotal role in a 
fragment of the Prophecy. Will you embrace this or fight your potential 
destiny? Will you dedicate your life to interpreting the Prophecy or 
ignore it as just a bunch of mystical nonsense? And might the Prophecy 
hold the answer to the Mourning itself?</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="50" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chapter 1: Character Creation</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p17</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 of thousands of years ago, the dragons of Argonnessen established a 
garrison of dragonborn in what is now Q'barra. These warriors were 
assigned to protect the region against the influence of the Lords of 
Dust. Over time they drifted away from their duties, building a nation 
in eastern Khorvaire and clashing with the goblinoids of the Dhakaani 
Empire.</p><p>This dragonborn nation came crashing down when one of the 
ancient fiendish Overlords stirred, unleashing fiends and corrupting 
many of the dragonborn themselves. Their nation in ruins, the dragonborn
 retreated to the darkness of Q'barra. They have remained there ever 
since, guarding against corruption and fighting the evil forces of the 
Poison Dusk—which is sometimes described as a cult devoted to a dragon, 
and sometimes as an army gathering in the name of a fiendish Overlord.</p><p>To
 date the dragonborn have largely ignored the humans of Q'barra, and the
 few humans who've encountered dragonborn believe they're some exotic 
type of lizardfolk. If you're a dragonborn, what has caused you to 
emerge from Q'barra? Are you on a quest to help your people or to oppose
 the Lords of Dust? Are you driven by wanderlust or curiosity? Did you 
serve as a mercenary in the Last War? How might your travels tie to the 
fate of your people?</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="55" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dwarves</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p19</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="56">

 origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends 
tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from
 "a land of endless ice." Many believe this refers to the arctic lands 
of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have 
come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant
 dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p><p>Most
 dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the 
mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient 
deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the 
goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this 
ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles 
driven from the realm below—which was later destroyed by the daelkyr. 
Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of 
returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient 
nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="57" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dwarves of the Mror Holds</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p19</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to 
the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim
 the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many 
weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these 
weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but 
others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions—strange 
symbiotic items (some of which appear in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12">chapter 5</a>) that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p><p>Some
 clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any 
exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. 
Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use 
against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be
 an important element of your character's background; you might be a 
Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr 
magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic 
of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p><p>Another
 important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why 
you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some 
suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="58">Leaving the Mror Holds</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of 
the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the 
foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to 
family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to 
transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes—and particularly 
to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability
 of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection
 to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love 
the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout 
followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider 
Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, 
and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a
 time.</p><p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, 
consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in 
your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest 
family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you 
choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? 
Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="60" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dwarves and Dragonmarks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p20</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its 
origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live 
across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and 
their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p><p>In addition
 to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates 
Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to 
remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. 
As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council 
that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the 
other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond 
the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of 
daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="61" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Elves</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p20</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p class="rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last">“<i>Put

 of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of 
Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion 
is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the
 magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained 
loyal to them, forming the drow—assassins bred to prey on their other 
kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island 
nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the 
introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty
 thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p><p>Neither
 the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have 
much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have 
immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less 
integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are 
virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p><p>As a whole, elves are driven by 
tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves
 strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the
 course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little 
over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly 
evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your 
relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your 
ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, 
and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="62" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">High Elves: The Aereni</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p20</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="63">

			</div></div><p></p><p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts
 of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars—against 
giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, 
becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood,
 a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to
 follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In 
this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead
 to live on.</p><p>The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus 
Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the 
northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the 
Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most 
often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the 
Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their
 patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.</p><p>In creating a 
Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron 
ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if 
your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary 
archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a
 war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? 
Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this 
something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another 
elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that 
character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival 
of yours?</p><p>Also consider why you are traveling with a group of 
player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band)
 instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of 
your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you 
pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are
 you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you 
turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions
 of a rival?</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="66" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Double-Bladed Scimitar</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p21</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#double-bladed%20scimitar_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="double-bladed%20scimitar_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Double-Bladed Scimitar</a> entry.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="67" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Feat: Revenant Blade</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p22</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/feats.html#revenant%20blade_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="feats.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="revenant%20blade_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Revenant Blade</a> entry.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="68" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Elves of the Five Nations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p22</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Throughout
 history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other 
peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated 
(as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often
 wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. 
Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five 
Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and 
druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sharn.</p><p>As
 an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among 
the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and 
tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life 
entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or 
you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors 
and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p><p>Consider 
also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect 
you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your 
party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that 
long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the 
friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last 
War? Did you fight in the war?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="69" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Drow of Xen'drik</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p22</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Long
 ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the 
giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, 
and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their 
legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal 
remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living 
descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p><p>When the 
elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the 
giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. 
Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the
 giants' malevolent influence.</p><p>Three distinct drow cultures formed
 after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, 
hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and
 other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the 
Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the 
Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across 
Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a 
fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled
 into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They 
wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr
 and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p><p>When creating a drow
 character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori 
hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your
 way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that 
can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing
 a personal path to glory?</p><p>How do you react to meeting members of 
other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize 
that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your 
people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of 
distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time 
the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with 
another elf member of your adventuring party.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="70" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Elves and Dragonmarks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p22</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and
 the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into 
an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal 
to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise 
to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of 
espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate 
ventures related to art and entertainment.</p><p>Phiarlan blood still 
runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the Mark of Shadow appears once
 or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always 
inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Blades—an espionage agency 
in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,6,aerenal,0">chapter 2</a>).</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="71" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gnomes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p22</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p class="rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last">“<i>Five words can defeat a thousand swords.</i>”</p><p><span class="rd__quote-by">— Zil proverb</span></p><p>The
 average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a 
curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially 
useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest 
physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words—whether 
that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a 
rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly 
busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking 
questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a 
cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse
 of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="72" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gnomes of Zilargo</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p23</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>To
 say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful 
exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. 
Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by
 the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of 
schemes and feuds, some of which persist well into adulthood. Even a 
gnome with a good heart and noble goals—of which there are many—often 
still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable 
tools of honesty or brute force.</p><p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the 
forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in 
trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as 
messengers and guides.</p><p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, 
consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. 
The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free 
to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="73">Zil Schemes</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of 
multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a 
family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan 
Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families 
(Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and 
lyrical; a Zil proverb claims "the sweetest song is the name of a

usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. 
House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the 
divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and
 under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,5">chapter 2</a>). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p><p>As

corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a 
number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated 
into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their 
civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands
 of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among 
themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once 
this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and 
Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the 
Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the 
underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they 
have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their 
ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior 
even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the 
working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to 
look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the 
Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't 
have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence,
 and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. 
Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the 
strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, 
bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are 
typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but 
exceptional goblins join the <i>khesh'dar</i> ("silent folk"), learning 
the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents 
across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might
 turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani 
clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are
 you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to 
defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the 
Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your 
position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="83" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Goblinoid Names</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p25</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Goblinoid

You humans come from Sarlona. Elves are from Aerenal. Me? I'm a true child of Khorvaire.</i>”</p><p><span class="rd__quote-by">— Nandon Tam, Khoravar activist</span></p><p>From
 the Towering Woods of the Eldeen Reaches to the slums of Sharn, 
half-elves are found across Khorvaire. New half-elves are born in every 
generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, 
with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, 
though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, 
giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and 
House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term 
"half-elf," instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning 
"children of Khorvaire."</p><p>The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a
 half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider 
half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among 
humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias 
than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be 
mistaken for human.</p><p>In making a half-elf character, consider 
whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were 
members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride,
 a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="86" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Khoravar</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p26</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a
 strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect
 each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when 
possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, 
shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners 
where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance 
to hear about local events and opportunities.</p><p>Many Khoravar 
espouse the idea of "the bridge between," the notion that the Khoravar 
are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members 
of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy 
often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are 
fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build 
bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These 
Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey 
patrons.</p><p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among 
themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes 
perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who 
speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p><p>As
 you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to 
describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide 
inspiration for it.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="87">Khoravar Origin</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic
 tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of 
dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across 
Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along 
with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they
 are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents
 to use.</p><p>Lightfoot halflings are the more widespread halfling 
subrace, especially in the Talenta Plains, but stout halflings are found
 within nearly every halfling community.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="90" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Talenta Halflings</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p27</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended 
up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who 
remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In 
their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs 
across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across 
Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and 
expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of 
Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p><p>As you make a Talenta halfling 
character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains.
 Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've 
remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was
 wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in
 search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, 
who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You 
could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or
 simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p><p>Also,
 consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in
 the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and 
class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion,
 take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after 
dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) 
totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta 
halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur 
companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your
 connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.</p><p>Finally,
 it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that 
reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some 
inspiration.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="91">Halfling Quirks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards,
 barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course,
 these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and 
other criminals.</p><p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal 
enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in 
Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches 
across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you 
decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or 
charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a 
connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who 
occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin
 in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or
 you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps 
you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the 
criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also
 be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's 
group patron, as described later in this chapter.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="93" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Halflings and Dragonmarks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p28</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Two
 dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of 
Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both
 marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same
 time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries 
before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House 
Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans 
by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. 
There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both 
halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the 
continent.</p><p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark 
of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it 
allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the
 land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both 
nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still 
employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the 
well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, 
they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even
 today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries.
 Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of 
them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing 
their limits and pursuing new ideas.</p><p>Humans prove extremely

 of years before humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by 
wild orcs and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire 
scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: 
the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of 
the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the 
secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of 
the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the
 Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical 
seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected 
Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The
 Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok 
Shash, the "binding flame"), who devote their lives to battling the 
fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes
 sometimes hear the call of Kalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, 
leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li><li class="rd__li ">The
 Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot 
Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them
 underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are
 rare.</li><li class="rd__li ">The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li></ul><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="99" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Orcs of the Shadow Marches</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p31</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and 
binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain
 the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's 
corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and 
embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow 
both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and 
centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p><p>Humans
 settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped 
to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain 
Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal 
numbers.</p><p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow
 Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world.

the Demon Wastes. Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces 
bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If
 you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could 
be that you were destined for some evil purpose—perhaps even serving as 
an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord—and you are fleeing that destiny.</p><p>Other
 tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of 
the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest 
zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings 
are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p><p>Finally,
 the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is 
populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from Sarlonan mages who 
bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful 
warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant 
contact with the Five Nations and few know it exists. Your character

with blue fire as his wounds close and vanish. A half-orc bounty hunter 
reaches out with the power of his mark to find his prey. A human 
artificer touches a creation forge, and the symbol on her hand flares as
 the eldritch machine rumbles to life. Each of these people possesses a 
dragonmark, a symbol etched on the skin in colors more vivid than any 
tattoo, magical power made flesh.</p><p>A dragonmark enhances the user's
 ability to perform certain tasks. For example, the Mark of Making 
guides the hands of the smith, while the Mark of Shadows helps its 
bearer avoid enemies. The power of a dragonmark can also manifest in 
more dramatic ways. The Mark of Storms can scatter enemies with a blast 
of wind, while the Mark of Shadows can weave illusions.</p><p>You can't 
buy or choose to develop a dragonmark; each mark is tied to bloodlines 
within specific species, as summarized in the Dragonmarks and Their 
Houses table. A dragonmark appears on a person around adolescence, 
though not every heir manifests the mark.</p><p>Long ago, the families 
that carry the marks joined together to form the dragonmarked houses. 
Over the course of centuries, these houses have used their gifts to 
establish powerful monopolies. For example, only House Lyrandar heirs 
with the Mark of Storms can pilot airships. This control over vital 
services gives the houses tremendous power.</p><p>In the past, the 
dragonmarked houses were held in check by the united kingdom of Galifar.
 But in the wake of the Last War, people wonder if any nation has the 
power to enforce its wishes on the houses.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="109" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">All about the Houses</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p37</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Every dragonmarked house has traditions and secrets. Here's a few facts that apply to most of the houses:</p><p><b>Enclaves</b>.
 Most dragonmarked houses maintain enclaves in major cities. These serve
 as strongholds and hubs for house businesses. A city may also have any 
number of businesses tied to the house, but these are simply providing 
services and don't have any direct connection to house leadership.</p><p><b>Names and Ranks</b>.
 Any heir of the house who develops a dragonmark is allowed to add the 
d' prefix to the house name: for example, Merrix d'Cannith. Despite the 
Korth Edicts' proscription against house members holding noble titles, 
regional leaders within the houses are called barons. Most houses are 
led by a matriarch or patriarch, though some are led by a council.</p><p><b>Emblems</b>.
 Each dragonmarked house has an emblem, a distinctive symbol that 
features on their heraldry, official seals, crafted goods, and anything 
else that warrants the house's stamp of authenticity. Each house's 
emblem appears along with the related dragonmark on the following pages.</p><p><b>The Twelve</b>. The Twelve is an organization that facilitates cooperation among the dragonmarked houses.</p><p><b>Excoriates</b>. Excoriates are dragonmarked heirs who have been cut off from their houses.</p><p><b>Foundlings</b>. Foundlings are people who have a dragonmark yet have no tie to a dragonmarked house.</p><p><b>Test of Siberys</b>.
 Dragonmarks manifest around adolescence. Each house puts its heirs 
through a trial called the Test of Siberys. The specific trials vary by 
house, but they place the heir in circumstances where they are likely to
 manifest the mark, if they have it. About half of the members of a 
bloodline manifest the mark.</p><p><b>Korth Edicts</b>. The Korth Edicts
 prevent the houses from owning land, holding noble titles, or 
maintaining military forces (with an exception for Deneith). The edicts 
were established when the Five Nations were united. Today, many in the 
houses feel the edicts have become obsolete in the wake of the Last War.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="110" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Creating a Dragonmarked Character</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p37</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Dragonmarks manifest on certain members of a few species, represented in the rules by variant race options:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">For <b>humans</b> and <b>half-orcs</b>, a dragonmark is a variant race that replaces traits associated with those races.</li><li class="rd__li ">For <b>half-elves</b>,
 a dragonmark is a variant race that lets you keep some half-elf traits 
and replace others with the traits associated with your mark.</li><li class="rd__li ">For <b>dwarves</b>, <b>elves</b>, <b>gnomes</b>, and <b>halflings</b>, the dragonmark replaces your subrace.</li></ul><p>So, if you're making an elf character, you can choose to take the Mark of Shadow instead of being a wood elf or a high elf.</p><p>There is another option related to dragonmarks if your group uses feats: the Aberrant Dragonmark feat (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,2,feat%3a%20aberrant%20dragonmark,0">below</a>)

 are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are 
establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in
 the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to 
the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from
 it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following
 options:</p><p><b>Agent</b>. You have a close, ongoing relationship 
with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are 
actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble 
background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.</p><p><b>Independent Scion</b>.
 You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your 
independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you
 also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to 
reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the 
Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of 
Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.</p><p><b>Excoriate</b>.
 When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from
 their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. 
Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still 
called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to 
deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a 
sage who engaged in forbidden research?</p><p><b>Foundling</b>. Your 
ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may
 not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your 
dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about 
the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith 
ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the 
houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM
 about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want 
them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do 
you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite
 being an outsider?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="113" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Powers of the Mark</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p38</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Each
 dragonmark grants a set of abilities that reflect the inherent powers 
of the mark. Your dragonmarked race gives you a set of traits derived 
from the magic of your mark. If you are a spellcaster, your dragonmark 
also fuels or channels some of your spells. Each dragonmark's 
description includes a list of dragonmark spells that flow from the 
magic of the mark. If you play a character with the Spellcasting or the 
Pact Magic class feature, your dragonmark spells are added to the spell 
list for each of your spellcasting classes, thereby expanding the spell 
options available to you.</p><p>You might also consider your dragonmark 
the source of any or all of your spells or class features. As a cleric 
with the Mark of Healing, for example, you could say your mark is the 
sole source of the healing and supportive spells you cast, or your magic
 might come from a combination of your mark's power and your faith in 
the gods. As a warlock, your aberrant dragonmark might actually be your 
fiendish patron, the source of all your magic. These descriptions add 
flavor to your character but don't change your character's abilities, 
beyond the dragonmark spells added to your spell list.</p><p>Over the 
centuries, the houses have developed tools that enhance and channel the 
powers of a mark, and these items (some appear in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12">chapter 5</a>) give the houses much of their economic power.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="114" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dragonmark Appearance</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p38</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, 
each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of 
the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, 
while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with 
vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly. When 
used, they grow warm to the touch and sometimes glow (though this 
doesn't produce useful illumination). A dragonmark can't be removed—even
 if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually 
manifests on another part of the bearer's body. All dragonmarks share a 
similar initial appearance, but a dragonmark can grow in size and 
complexity as a character gains levels and uses it to cast more powerful
 magic.</p><p>While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your 
dragonmark could have a unique quality. Roll on the Dragonmark Quirks 
table for inspiration.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="115">Dragonmark Quirks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 houses, but its barons are generally content; they're more interested

 Vadalis breeds and trains beasts for a wide range of purposes. While 
the house maintains vast cattle ranches and trains horses and hounds, 
the Mark of Handling allows Vadalis to work with more exotic creatures

trained. Even with the Mark of Handling, this is dangerous work; there's
 a lot of turnover at the bulette ranch. But these exotic creatures 
aren't enough to satisfy the most innovative members of the house, 
leading to the practice of magebreeding. Using dragonshard focus items, 
Vadalis has found ways to create magical creatures. Typically, this 
results in a superior version of a creature—an animal that is stronger, 
faster, and smarter. But rumors claim that Vadalis has crafted monsters 
of its own. Some rumors even insist that Vadalis is trying to magebreed 
better humans.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="136" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Variant Human: Mark of Handling</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p42</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#human%20(mark%20of%20handling)_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="human%20(mark%20of%20handling)_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Human (Mark of Handling)</a> entry.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="137" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mark of Healing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p43</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 majority of inns, taverns, and restaurants in the Five Nations are 
either directly owned by House Ghallanda or licensed by its Hosteler's 
Guild. Most people give little thought to House Ghallanda; when compared
 to the soldiers of House Deneith and the factories of House Cannith, an
 alliance of innkeepers seems harmless and inconsequential. But 
Ghallanda's strength lies in charm and connections. A Ghallanda 
innkeeper hears many things—if you want to know what's really going on 
in a community, talk to the halfling bartender. The leaders of House 
Ghallanda don't sell information; they prefer to build friendship and 
deal in favors. But should a Ghallanda baron ever truly need something, 
they likely have a favor they can call in.</p><p>Ghallanda has a number 
of "bound businesses"—franchises run directly by the house. The Gold 
Dragon Inn is such a business, with Gold Dragon Inns being found in 
every major city, each serving a familiar menu and providing similar 
services. But many Ghallanda heirs take pride in creating their own 
unique businesses. There are also many independent restaurants, inns, 
and taverns licensed by House Ghallanda. The blink dog emblem is an 
assurance that a locale meets Ghallanda standards of health and 
quality—but not every inn is run by a halfling.</p><p>House Ghallanda's 
mandate extends beyond providing creature comforts to travelers. Every 
one of the house's enclaves—which are more numerous than those of any 
other dragonmarked house—is a sanctuary beyond the legal reach of any 
government or dragonmarked house. Baron Yoren and his daughter Chervina 
have greatly expanded the house's presence even in remote areas such as 
the edge of the Demon Wastes, guided by their study of the Draconic

 Cannith dominates all forms of manufacturing, both mystical and 
mundane. Gorgon-marked Cannith forgeholds use streamlined forms of 
production to quickly produce common goods. Even independent artisans 
often learn their trade at Cannith academies and adhere to Cannith 
standards. The House of Making builds the tools the other houses rely 
upon, and it has always been the unspoken leader of the Twelve.</p><p>The
 Last War was a time of great opportunity for Cannith. Every nation 
wanted weapons and warforged, along with mundane arms and armor. The war
 raised the house up, and then tore it down. House Cannith was based in 
Cyre, and the Mourning destroyed the house leadership and key 
facilities. Now three barons jockey to fill the leadership vacuum: the 
alchemist Jorlanna of Fairhaven, weaponsmith Zorlan of Korth, and Merrix
 of Sharn, innovator of warforged. It remains to be seen whether one of 
these leaders will unite the house, or if it will shatter under the 
strain. If you're an heir of House Cannith, you should decide which of 
these barons you serve or if you have other ideas about the house's 
future.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="145" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Variant Human: Mark of Making</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p45</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#human%20(mark%20of%20making)_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="human%20(mark%20of%20making)_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Human (Mark of Making)</a> entry.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="146" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mark of Passage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p46</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

transportation for centuries, but now the house is facing challenges. 
The Mournland is a dramatic obstacle for ground transportation, and 
Baron Kwanti d'Orien has had tremendous difficulty securing funds to 
rebuild the lightning rail line across the blasted landscape. Indeed, he
 spends most of his time away from his headquarters in Aundair, trying 
to raise funds for the project while keeping an eye on house operations.
 He travels across western Khorvaire in his personal lightning rail 
coach, the <i>Silver Unicorn</i>—a reference to the house's unicorn emblem.</p><p>House
 Orien's problems don't end with the Mournland, though. The expanding 
role of Lyrandar airships threatens the house's business. Baron Kwanti 
would like to be able to offer more instantaneous transportation, but 
long-distance teleportation is a service only the strongest Orien 
dragonmarks can provide. So the house is working with House Cannith in 
an effort to unlock and enhance this gift of the Mark of Passage. Orien 
heirs might be caught up in these experiments or in the rivalry with 
House Lyrandar.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="148" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Variant Human: Mark of Passage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p46</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#human%20(mark%20of%20passage)_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="human%20(mark%20of%20passage)_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Human (Mark of Passage)</a> entry.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="149" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mark of Scribing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p47</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

Phiarlan—and the foundation of House Thuranni. House Phiarlan continues 
to offer entertainment and espionage in the lands west of the Mournland,
 while Thuranni operates in the eastern lands. As a rule, Phiarlan elves
 are the better spies and Thuranni agents are superior assassins. 
Thuranni and Phiarlan maintain a peaceful relationship, but rivalries 
run deep.</p><p>Baron Elar d'Thuranni is said to be responsible for the 
Shadow Schism. Ruling the house from an enclave in Regalport, he is 
always accompanied by a shadowy pair, rumored to be embodiments of 
shadow itself. The displacer beast serves as the young house's emblem.</p><p>The
 lands of House Phiarlan, known as the Demesnes, are the foremost 
centers of the arts in the Five Nations, each focusing on a specific 
artistic tradition: the written word, movement arts, music, material 
arts, and the arts of illusion, puppetry, oratory, and acting. Baron 
Elvinor Elorrenthi leads the house from the last of those, the Demesne 
of Shadow, which is located in Sharn. The hydra serves as House 
Phiarlan's emblem.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="157" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Elf Subrace: Mark of Shadow</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p49</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#elf%20(mark%20of%20shadow)_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="elf%20(mark%20of%20shadow)_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Elf (Mark of Shadow)</a> entry.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="158" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mark of Storm</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p50</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

there to help. The Defenders Guild of House Kundarak trains locksmiths, 
security specialists, and more. It maintains the prison of Dreadhold,

 it's the Banking Guild that truly defines the house. Kundarak's lands 
in the Mror Holds include deep veins of precious metals, which the 
dwarves used to establish the banking industry of Khorvaire. Anyone who 
makes a living from coin—from bankers to goldsmiths—likely learned their
 skills at House Kundarak. The security of banks bearing the Kundarak 
manticore emblem is legendary. The house also provides a special service
 to those who can afford it: a system of extradimensional vaults, 
allowing a client to store their goods in one location and retrieve them
 at any other Kundarak enclave.</p><p>House Kundarak has a close 
alliance with House Sivis. Like the House of Scribing, Kundarak has 
worked to earn the trust of its clients and to establish a reputation 
for unshakable integrity. The house has no love of renegade dwarves 
using their marks to turn a profit, and such rogues strive to avoid the 
eye of Kundarak.</p><p>As the dwarves of the Mror Holds have come into 
increasing conflict with the daelkyr, Lord Morrikan d'Kundarak has 
instructed house heirs to establish connections with the Gatekeeper 
druids. The druids have much in common with the house, being the 
creators of the wards that protect Eberron from the daelkyr.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="164" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dwarf Subrace: Mark of Warding</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p51</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/races.html#dwarf%20(mark%20of%20warding)_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="races.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="dwarf%20(mark%20of%20warding)_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Dwarf (Mark of Warding)</a> entry.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="165" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aberrant Dragonmarks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p52</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p class="rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last">“<i>Your sigil creates, child of Cannith.

their powers are generally constructive. But there is another kind of 
dragonmark, which is dangerous to both the bearer and the people around 
them. Aberrant marks often appear when people from different 
dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions 
are forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on 
members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two 
aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same 
power, they might manifest in different ways.</p><p>It usually takes 
time for a character to learn to control an aberrant mark, and in time, 
people might be hurt by it. This factor has led to the general 
superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous.</p><p>Aberrant
 marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were
 more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan 
could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague
 wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses
 united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a
 persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as
 the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant 
dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the 
Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="166" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Feat: Aberrant Dragonmark</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p52</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>See the <a href="https://5e.tools/feats.html#aberrant%20dragonmark_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="feats.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="aberrant%20dragonmark_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Aberrant Dragonmark</a> entry.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="167" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Background</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p53</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The <a href="https://5e.tools/backgrounds.html#house%20agent_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="backgrounds.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="house%20agent_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">house agent</a> background is the perfect background option for a character tied to a dragonmarked house.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="168" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chapter 1: Character Creation</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p54</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="169">

alternative, your characters could form your own organization that might

dragonmarked houses, small home-town newspapers, national rulers, 
powerful immortals, and various other organizations and individuals hold
 the reins of power in Khorvaire. They bind the fabric of society 
together, and they are responsible for much of the change that occurs in
 the world—often by means of agents that include parties of adventurers.
 An adventuring group that has a powerful backer as a patron has a clear
 place in the world, access to additional resources, and a reason to 
work together in pursuit of a common cause.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="173" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">How Patrons Work</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p64</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Each type of patron in this section includes the following information:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">An example of the general type of patron, including information about its organization, headquarters, allies, and enemies</li><li class="rd__li ">Suggestions

 are more than a resource for your group to draw on, they are also a 
responsibility. Some patrons might be eager to support your group, while
 others might prove more demanding.</p><p>Your group's patron might 
occasionally come to you and give you an assignment. This can be an easy
 way to get into an adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond
 to your patron's demands, and interesting stories can emerge if you 
decide to refuse an assignment.</p><p>Even a patron that isn't 
heavy-handed can significantly motivate your group. Maybe you'll seek 
adventures based on what pleases your patron and so earn a reward. A 
university, for example, might not send you on a particular mission, but
 you might decide to follow leads to an ancient artifact hoping the 
university might reward you for bringing it back. You have the freedom 
to chart your own destiny, while still letting the patron shape the 
nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.</p><p>It might help to think of the patrons in this section in terms of three broad categories of autonomy:</p><p>With a <b>highly directive</b>
 patron, you are an employee of an organization, and the organization 
often tells you what to do. Crime syndicates, dragonmarked houses, 
espionage agencies, military forces, and newspapers are typically highly
 directive.</p><p>With a <b>highly autonomous</b> patron, you are more 
like a freelancer. Your patron might offer you assignments or reward you
 for achieving certain objectives, but it doesn't dictate your 
activities. Adventurers' guilds, heads of state, immortal beings, 
inquisitive agencies, religious orders, and universities are typically 
highly autonomous.</p><p>In a <b>player-directed</b> organization, you 
don't have a patron because your adventuring party is in charge. You're 
the boss; you tell others what to do, and you're responsible to no one

military force, or newspaper can be a player-directed organization.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="175" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Benefits and Favors</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p64</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Every
 group patron offers your party a number of benefits for your service. 
These benefits range from standard business arrangements, like a salary 
and access to staff facilities, to more extraordinary boons, like 
audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. 
Specific benefits are presented in more detail in the benefits section 
of each group patron.</p><p>Beyond the benefits described in each group 
patron's description, patrons can also grant additional favors. If your 
party is in good standing with your patron—proving yourselves reliable 
agents who fulfill the group's goals—your patron might grant requests 
for additional favors. A favor might take a variety of forms appropriate
 to the patron's area of influence or expertise, such as small loans, 
specialized equipment, or access to people and places you wouldn't 
otherwise have. Patrons who you regularly find yourself in conflict with
 aren't likely to grant you favors, unless doing so directly furthers 
their goals.</p><p>In any case, the DM shouldn't feel limited to 
providing only the benefits noted in each group patron's description. 
Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn't have 
otherwise, and a patron might use their varied resources to guide their 
agents or prepare them for greater adventures.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="176" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Being Your Own Patron</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p64</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>For
 certain kinds of organizations, you can either join an existing group 
or found your own. For some players, the idea of running a crime 
syndicate, inquisitive agency, mercenary company, or newspaper is much 
more exciting than working for someone else. Founding your own 
organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at 
the cost of support and reliable work.</p><p>The information in this 
section applies whether you join an organization or found your own. When
 you're the boss, some of the benefits of belonging to an organization 
become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary
 company, for example, you need to stock your own armory rather than 
drawing on an existing organization's stockpile. The organization brings
 in income, but you'll have to spend some of it to keep the organization
 running.</p><p>When you run your own organization, you can use the Running a Business downtime activity (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,6">chapter 6</a> of the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>)
 to reflect your organization's ongoing activities. More than one 
character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to 
determine the business's performance, add the total days spent by all 
the characters to the roll to determine the business's success (still 
observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply 
that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this 
downtime activity.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="177" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patrons in Eberron</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p65</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Here

 group has ties to a network of professional adventurers. These experts 
share contacts, resources, and leads on all manner of unusual and often 
dangerous work. Joining such a guild makes an ideal choice if you want 
to keep your entanglements with a patron to a minimum, as an 
adventurers' guild doesn't direct your activities or reward you for 
completing adventures.</p><p>With a few exceptions, adventurers' guilds 
are local in scope, since their primary benefits center on a guildhall. 
They might point you to adventures halfway across the world, but the 
general assumption is that you'll always come home to your guildhall, 
sooner or later.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="180" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Clifftop Adventurers' Guild</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p65</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Sharn's
 Clifftop neighborhood, located in the upper part of the Dura district, 
has long served as a crossroads for adventurers and soldiers of fortune.
 A dwarf named Shekkal Korranor established the Clifftop Adventurers' 
Guild 150 years ago, intending it as a place where explorers and 
wanderers could find support and good company. Shekkal died in the Last 
War, but the guild remains—a social club for adventurers and a one-stop 
marketplace for anyone seeking capable champions.</p><p>The Clifftop 
guild has a reputation as a collection of helpful and good-hearted 
adventurers. Members who tarnish the guild's reputation can no longer 
take advantage of the guild's benefits.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="181" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Guildhall.</span></span> <p>The
 Clifftop Adventurers' Guild headquarters is the physical and social 
center of its district, a massive stone edifice built with the riches 
acquired over a lifetime of adventuring. Part quiet library, part 
comfortable inn, part active gymnasium, and part rowdy tavern, the 
guildhall contains practically every facility adventurers could need to 
train, study, and socialize. The neighborhood around it caters to 
adventurers' other needs with its variety of shops and services.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="182" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Membership.</span></span> <p>Most
 of the members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild have a modest amount 
of experience as successful adventurers. Nearly everyone can boast of a 
successful delve into the old ruins beneath Sharn or an expedition to 
the Talenta Plains. The guild's leader, a dwarf named Sumara "Summer" 
Korranor, is a descendant of its founder and a fixture around the 
guildhall.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="183" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Allies.</span></span> <p>Relationships
 with most of the guild's allies are based on business and built on 
upstanding reputations. Ultimately, though, the guild is a loose 
affiliation of groups, and organizations that have a good relationship 
with one of those groups might not transfer their good will to another. 
The following groups do brisk business with members of the Clifftop 
Adventurers' Guild:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="184" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Voice of Breland—Watch Commander or Crime Lord?</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p65</span></span><p>Watch
 Commander Lian Halamar, in charge of the large and prestigious 
Daggerwatch Garrison in Sharn's Dura quarter, has long been suspected of
 ties to the infamous Boromar Clan. Though these suspicions are often 
dismissed as simple prejudice in the assumption that any halfling in 
Sharn must be associated with the crime syndicate, the Voice of Breland,
 in cooperation with civic-minded members of the Clifftop Adventurers' 
Guid, have uncovered stunning evidence confirming this connection. The 
Clifftop guild denies claims that these accusations embody the latest 
fracas in the long-running tensions between the Daggerwatch Garrison and
 the city's various groups of heroes for hire.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Affiliated guilds</b>.
 Beyond Sharn, the guild has established good relations with adventuring
 guilds across Khorvaire, many of which have reciprocal agreements: 
their members can use the Clifftop facilities when they are in Sharn, 
and Clifftop guild members can make use of their facilities as well. 
Lists of these other guilds are kept in the Sharn guildhall.</p><p><b>Clifftop businesses</b>.
 The guild is a prominent feature in its neighborhood, and much of the 
area is dedicated to meeting guild's needs. Some businesses there offer 
small (5 percent) discounts to guild members, and all businesses are 
eager to avoid angering members of the guild lest they lose the business
 of other members.</p><p><b>House Sivis</b>. A Speakers' Guild enclave 
in Clifftop specializes in translating texts from Xen'drik. It also 
provides legal services for adventurers in trouble.</p><p><b>House Tharashk</b>.
 The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop provides the services of guides with 
extensive experience exploring Xend'rik, and it is careful to retain 
only guides who receive positive referrals from guild members. House 
Tharashk also uses the guild as a means to hire adventurers to serve as 
bodyguards on their own prospecting expeditions.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="185" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>Individual
 adventuring groups readily make lasting enemies, and occasionally that 
animosity extends to the guild as a whole—as is the case with the 
following organizations:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Deathsgate Explorers' Club</b>.
 A fierce rivalry simmers between the Clifftop guild and Sharn's other 
local adventurers' guild. Sometimes the rivalry can be described as 
almost friendly, but the Deathsgate guild occasionally escalates it with
 vandalism of the Clifftop guildhall or even physical (but usually 
nonlethal) attacks on guild members in dark alleys.</p><p><b>Sharn Watch</b>.
 Clifftop is protected of the Daggerwatch Garrison and Watch Commander 
Lian Halamar. Halamar has no love for adventurers and is happy to catch 
guild members on the wrong side of the law.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="186" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Guild Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p66</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As members of an adventurers' guild, your group gains the following benefits:</p><p><b>Accommodations</b>.
 Guild members can stay at the guildhall. The room is comparable to one 
you'd find in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 sp per day).</p><p><b>Dues</b>.
 These benefits require the annual contribution of 13 gp paid to the 
Clifftop Adventurers' Guild. These dues fund the guild's services and 
activities. (Other guilds typically charge dues somewhere between 10 and
 15 gp per year.)</p><p><b>Information</b>. An adventurers' guild 
headquarters makes a good place to learn about topics relevant to 
adventurers' interests. If you need to find someone who's knowledgeable 
about the Mournland, for example, the Clifftop guild's headquarters in 
Sharn is a good place to look.</p><p><b>Referrals</b>. The guild can 
recommend hired services to its members, drawing on other guild members'
 experiences to provide honest, reliable, and skillful hirelings.</p><p><b>Storage</b>.
 The guild will store items for its members. The Clifftop guild has an 
account with House Kundarak banks that allow its members to store 
valuables in secure vaults. Some guilds have access to items such as a <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#bag%20of%20holding_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="bag%20of%20holding_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">bag of holding</a>
 or a safe that opens into a similar extradimensional space. In the 
worst case, an item can be hidden in a guildhall's basement for a time.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="187" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Build Your Group</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p66</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Membership

 an adventuring group has no particular contact within the larger guild.
 There's a local leader or bookkeeper who collects dues, but otherwise 
you might interact with a variety of different members of the guild in 
different contexts—when looking for a contract, gathering referrals, 
staying in the guildhall, and so on. The Guild Contact table provides

launchpad for all manner of adventures. Potential employers bring all 
manner of work to the guildhall, posting messages or seeking out those 
with specific fields of expertise. Guild members also relate news about 
opportunities via word of mouth. Such jobs might resemble those assigned
 by any other patron. Without a patron directing your assignments, your 
group is free to pursue its own goals, whether you're seeking wealth, 
struggling against evil, pursuing a personal vendetta, or simply

 any of these cases, the potential employer might represent an

organization—running up against a crime syndicate while pursuing a 
criminal job, perhaps, or competing with university researchers to 
plunder a ruin. This competition might turn into a rivalry, or it could 
evolve into employment, with the crime syndicate or university 
recognizing your talent and becoming your patron.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="193" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Other Adventurers' Guilds</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p68</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Few
 guilds besides the Clifftop guild are widely known, but the following 
organizations have carved out reputations for themselves:</p><p><b>Deathsgate Explorers' Club</b>.
 Named for the lower-class district in Sharn where it maintains its 
guildhall, the Deathsgate Explorers' Club is a rough-and-tumble guild 
made up largely of Last War veterans. Deathsgaters rarely undertake 
adventures from altruistic motives, demanding prompt payment or other 
reciprocal arrangements. They have a fierce rivalry with the Clifftop 
Adventurers' Guild.</p><p><b>Wayfinder Foundation</b>. Founded by a 
renowned hunter and explorer, Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, the Wayfinder 
Foundation is an exclusive adventurers' guild that welcomes only 
experienced and renowned members. Dayne suffers from a wasting curse 
that prevents him from undertaking further adventures of his own, so he 
has put his considerable fortune to use in sponsoring great expeditions.
 The Wayfinder Foundation has an unusually wide reach for an 
adventurers' guild, with guildhalls found across Khorvaire as well as in
 the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Its headquarters, and the 
residence of its wealthy patron, is in Fairhaven.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="194" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Crime Syndicate</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p68</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your
 group is a team of crooks that's part of an organized crime syndicate. 
You're more talented and have a wider range of skills than most thugs 
and burglars, so your crew might be entrusted with more important tasks 
than simply roughing up local merchants or breaking into empty 
apartments. If you're anything like a typical adventuring party, you 
bring a combination of powerful magic, physical might, and a broad 
selection of skills to your work, making you well suited to missions 
like grand heists, high-profile assassinations, and epic cons.</p><p>Crime
 syndicates thrived during the Last War. The war left many people 
desperate, driving them into lives of crime. The war also demanded huge 
numbers of able-bodied soldiers, which reduced the ranks of law 
enforcement across Khorvaire. As a result, most settlements have some 
organized criminal element, ranging from small local thieves' guilds to 
international organizations with dozens of interconnected branches.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="195" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Boromar Clan</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p68</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Boromar Clan is the most powerful criminal organization in the city of 
Sharn. From its humble start as a gang of smugglers and thieves, the 
Boromars have risen to become one of the most influential forces in the 
city. They have a stranglehold on the smuggling trade and own the 
majority of the gambling halls in the city, while most of the fences and
 thieves in Sharn either work directly for the them or pay tribute in 
exchange for independence. The Boromars control a vast network of 
extortion, blackmail, and graft that extends throughout the city, and 
their influence reaches far beyond the criminal underworld. The early 
Boromar patriarchs invested wisely over the centuries, and today the 
Boromars are one of the Sixty, the elite tier of Sharn's aristocracy. 
The Boromar Clan owns warehouses, taverns, and inns throughout the city,
 and it has a considerable interest in the shipping trade. A Boromar 
heir sits on the city council of Sharn, and the current head of the clan
 is a member of the Gold Concord of the Aurum (described in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,11,the%20boromar%20clan,0">chapter 4</a>).</p><p>As
 much as some members of the Sharn Council and the Watch would like to 
see the Boromars disbanded, the syndicate is unlikely to collapse any 
time soon.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="196" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Membership.</span></span> <p>The
 core membership of the Boromar Clan—comprising about one in six of its 
members—is an extended family of halflings descended from immigrants who
 came to Sharn from the Talenta Plains. Another third of the members are
 unrelated halflings, and the rest belong to other species. The 
syndicate employs a wide variety of bookkeepers and administrators as 
well as burglars, con artists, smugglers, and other criminals. When a 
situation calls for physical violence, the Boromars usually hire 
freelancers—members of the Sharn Guard or agents of House Tarkanan. The 
Boromar family proper has a team of personal bodyguards called the 
Clawfoots, who are mostly fierce halfling warriors recently relocated 
from the Talenta Plains. They primarily defend Boromar holdings and 
headquarters in the halfling district of Little Plains.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="197" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Allies.</span></span> <p>The
 Boromar Clan has a reputation for omnipotence that makes even the 
forces of law and order in Sharn hesitant to cross it. It's far safer to
 be an ally of the syndicate, or at least to stay out of its way, than 
it is to be its enemy—and it's more lucrative to boot. The following 
groups count themselves among the Boromar Clan's closest allies:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>House Jorasco</b>.
 The head of the Boromar Clan, Saidan Boromar, is married to an unmarked
 heir of House Jorasco, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco. This marriage has 
created important ties between the Boromars and the halfling healers of 
Sharn. Members of the Boromar family can secure healing for free, and 
other members of the syndicate receive a 10 percent discount at Jorasco 
houses of healing.</p><p><b>Sharn Council</b>. Of the seventeen members 
of Sharn's city council, four have close ties to the Boromar 
Clan—including one, Ilyra Boromar, who reports directly to the head of 
the syndicate. These four vote as a bloc to ensure that the council 
doesn't take direct action against the Boromars, while enough of the 
other council members fear the syndicate that they tend to carry the 
vote. A member of the Boromar Clan can call in a favor to secure an 
audience with one of these councilors, though such does not guarantee 
aid.</p><p><b>Sharn Watch</b>. The Boromars have been bribing captains 
of the Sharn Watch for generations. What's more, if the Boromar Clan 
collapsed, the underworld would erupt in anarchy as dozens of petty 
crime lords fought for territory and position. As a result, a member of 
the Boromars can call in a favor to get minor criminal charges 
dismissed.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="198" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>Despite
 the Boromar Clan's position of strength in Sharn, it has many foes, and
 their unrelenting assaults have put the syndicate in what might be its 
most precarious position ever. Currently, the following groups pose the 
greatest threats to Boromar interests:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Daask</b>.
 The monstrous criminal guild called Daask, a pawn of the leaders of 
Droaam, has started launching violent raids against Boromar holdings 
over the last two years. A mobile organization using guerrilla tactics, 
Daask has managed to circumvent Boromar security and avoid serious 
reprisals for a range of violent thefts and sabotages. Agents of Daask 
go out of their way to harm up-and-coming Boromar agents.</p><p><b>Sharn Council</b>.
 Despite four friends on the city council, the Boromar Clan has several 
enemies as well. At least three councilors oppose the Boromars because 
of genuine concern for their constituents; two more oppose the syndicate
 because they're part of rival organizations (the Aurum and the 
Tyrants). Because of their influence, the council has so far refused to 
devote any resources to combating the rise of Daask, hoping the 
monstrous guild will bring down the Boromars. Individual members of the 
Boromar Clan can be sure that these councilors will oppose any petition 
they might bring to the council.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="199" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p69</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>With a crime syndicate as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="200" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Sharn Inquisitive—Savagery in style at Tain gala</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p69</span></span><p>The
 annual Tain Gala, as everyone knows, brings the wealthiest and most 
prominent citizens of Sharn together in a grand display of opulence and 
power. But last night, it also provided a shocking display of violence, 
as Saidan Boromar—head of the Boromar family, which is allegedly tied to
 all manner of criminal activities throughout the city—was confronted by
 a would-be assassin (whose name will not be made public until her next 
of kin have been identified and notified). Boromar and his wife, Mala 
Boromar d'Jorasco, escaped unharmed thanks to the timely intervention of
 their bodyguard, a recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains whose 
fascinating culture and fierce demeanor were both in plain view last 
night. A Boromar spokesperson identified the bodyguard as Halak Boromar,
 head of the Clawfoots—the Boromar family's personal guard, named for 
the dinosaurs ridden by halflings in the Talenta Plains.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Assignments</b>.
 The Boromar Clan doesn't pay you, but it might assign you to particular
 tasks. Sometimes these are tasks someone has hired the syndicate to 
perform (such as an assassination), in which case the syndicate passes 
85 percent of the fee on to your group. Other times, your aim is to 
enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), in which case you
 have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other 
syndicates might take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM's 
discretion.</p><p><b>Contraband</b>. You have access to your syndicate's
 "business" of dealing with contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. 
You don't receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find 
someplace to purchase them.</p><p><b>Fences</b>. Members or associates 
of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have
 access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just 
illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and even 
magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the
 work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> and <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XGE">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a>)
 to the fence. The drawback is that you don't get to choose whether to 
accept the offer you might receive—the fence makes that call for you.</p><p><b>Immunity</b>.
 As a member of the Boromar Clan, you are protected from other members 
of the clan. No one in your syndicate targets you for their own criminal
 operations. (Of course, the same is expected of you.) On the other 
hand, if you have rivals within the clan, they might find other ways to 
interfere with your activities.</p><p><b>Syndicate-Owned Businesses</b>.
 The Boromar Clan owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for 
laundering money. When you buy from one of these businesses, you get a 5
 percent discount. The DM decides what goods and services are available.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="201" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Build Your Group</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p69</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Naturally,
 a large portion of the Boromar Clan's members come from a criminal 
background. There's no reason characters with other backgrounds can't be
 part of the syndicate, though. The Boromars recruit ex-soldiers as 
muscle, trained sages for research, sailors to crew smuggling vessels, 
and charlatans and urchins for their unique talents. Consider some or 
all of these roles for characters in your party:</p><p><b>Bruiser</b>. 
Sometimes subtlety means breaking just one of a snitch's kneecaps. The 
Bruiser uses force and the threat of force to make sure that the crime 
syndicate gets what it wants. Strength is a natural prerequisite for the
 role, but Charisma can also be useful, especially when combined with 
proficiency in <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span>
 to reinforce the danger inherent in the Bruiser's presence. Plenty of 
Bruisers have a criminal past, but former soldiers are often recruited 
into this role as well. Fighters and rogues make natural Bruisers.</p><p><b>Burglar</b>. Agile and nimble, the Burglar relies on Dexterity and proficiency in skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="acrobatics_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Acrobatics</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="sleight%20of%20hand_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Sleight of Hand</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="stealth_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Stealth</span>
 to get in to a target location, take valuables, and get out without 
being noticed. Some Burglars specialize in certain types of theft, such 
as housebreaking or picking pockets. Besides characters with the 
criminal background, young urchins often find a place in criminal 
syndicates by filling this role. Rogues are natural Burglars, but anyone
 else with the right combination of skills and abilities can do the job.</p><p><b>Mastermind</b>.
 Somebody has to be the brains of any criminal operation—that's where 
the Mastermind comes in. A high Intelligence benefits this character, as
 does proficiency in skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="insight_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Insight</span> and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>.
 Masterminds often come from backgrounds such as acolyte, noble, or 
sage, that give them a broad range of knowledge to support their 
schemes. Bards, rogues, and wizards are often drawn to this role.</p><p><b>Safecracker</b>.
 The "breaking" part of "breaking and entering" is the Safecracker's 
job. A typical Safecracker might have proficiency with thieves' tools, 
as well as the Dexterity required to use them expertly. Intelligence can
 be important for figuring out complicated locks and secret doors. Many 
Safecrackers also boast a high Strength for those cases where lockpicks 
fail. Safecrackers often come from criminal backgrounds, but characters 
with experience using other tools and devices, including guild artisans 
and even sailors, also fall naturally into this role. Artificer or rogue
 makes a natural class choice for the Safecracker.</p><p><b>Talker</b>. 
From con artists to fences, anyone who relies on interpersonal skills 
and a network of contacts falls into the role of the Talker. Charisma 
proves useful for this role, along with proficiencies in skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span>.
 The charlatan background is perfect for Talkers, but criminals, 
urchins, and others can fill the role with the right skills. Bards are a
 natural fit for the job as well.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="202" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Types of Crime</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p70</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your

 city of Sharn is unusual in that it is home to no less than four 
powerful syndicates, which somehow have not yet managed to wipe each 
other out. The Boromar Clan is one crime syndicate, while the others 
include the following groups:</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="212" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Voice of Breland—Blood ADDICTS' Dragon Drug</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p72</span></span><p>Imagine
 it: a long-lasting state of euphoria, a feeling of power and energy, a 
measurable impact on certain magical powers, and the risk of addiction 
and deadly overdose with every use. That's the thrill of the drug called
 dragon's blood, which currently enjoys skyrocketing popularity in 
Sharn. Every day the death toll from this mysterious substance rises 
among "blood addicts." And no wonder, as it's produced in Droaam and 
sold in drams or "veins" by the monstrous thugs of Daask, who surely 
seek nothing less than to destroy the prosperity of Sharn but targeting 
its most precious resource: its sober, hardworking people. Remember 
friends, "Stay on the wagon. Say NO to dragon!"</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Daask</b>.
 Daask is an aggressive criminal organization with cells across 
Khorvaire. Led by monstrous immigrants from Droaam—gnolls, harpies, 
medusas, minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and others—the group is ultimately 
under the command of Sora Katra, one of the rulers of Droaam. Physical 
violence is its specialty, but Daask also dabbles in illegal drugs.</p><p><b>House Tarkanan</b>.
 House Tarkanan is known as a small order of highly skilled assassins 
and thieves in Sharn. Less well known is the fact that this guild 
consists primarily of criminals who bear aberrant dragonmarks—hence its 
choice of namesake, as Lord Halas Tarkanan united the bearers of these 
marks during the ancient War of the Mark.</p><p><b>The Tyrants</b>. The 
Tyrants are a mysterious group of shapeshifters who traffic in all 
manner of information. They sell secrets, blackmail powerful people, and
 forge everything from identification papers to coins and works of art.</p><p><b>Running Your Own</b>.
 Rather than join an existing syndicate, you can start your own. You 
need to establish your own headquarters and direct the activities of the
 <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;3d6&quot;}">3d6</span>
 criminals who work for you. By claiming a 15 percent share of their 
take, you can rely on an income that will sustain you at a modest 
lifestyle, plus an additional <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d6&quot;}">1d6</span>
 gp in profit per week. You can access contraband and fences as 
described earlier in this section, but you don't get a discount at 
syndicate-owned businesses unless you acquire some businesses of your 
own. You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct
 the activities of your syndicate.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="213" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dragonmarked House</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your
 group works for one of the most influential organizations in Khorvaire:
 the dragonmarked houses. Whether or not any member of your group 
carries a dragonmark or is even related to one of the houses by blood, 
you act on behalf of a house to advance its interests. You might 
function openly as representatives of the house, wearing its badge and 
exerting its authority, or you could be covert or unacknowledged agents.</p><p>The thirteen dragonmarked houses are described in detail earlier in this chapter.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="214" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>With a dragonmarked house as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:</p><p><b>Compensation</b>.
 Your patron house pays you for the work you do on its behalf. On 
average, the house pays each member of your group an amount equal to 10 
gp × the average level of your characters per day you spend on the 
mission.</p><p><b>House Services</b>. When you require the services 
provided by your patron house, you can secure them at a discounted rate 
(10 percent off the normal charge). You might also be able to trade in a
 favor to get extraordinary services or a larger discount.</p><p><b>Independence</b>.
 Each member of your group is issued papers that identifies you as 
agents of your patron house. Because the dragonmarked houses are bound 
to political neutrality by the terms of the ancient Korth Edicts, these 
papers guarantee you the right to travel freely across national borders 
on the business of your patron house. (If you assert that you are on the
 business of the house, even if you aren't, border agents are unlikely 
to challenge you.)</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="215" data-title-relative-index="2"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Build Your Group</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Dragonmarked
 houses employ adventurers who suit their needs. The roles characters 
play in a group with a dragonmarked house patron often have more to do 
with their relationship to the house than with the specific roles in the
 party. Consider some or all of these roles for your characters:</p><p><b>Adventurer</b>.
 Some characters are associated with your patron house because of their 
connection to its ruling family or its businesses. The Adventurer, 
though, is hired by the house for more traditional adventuring 
skills—usually capabilities that the house's other agents lack. The 
Adventurer might have a wide range of abilities, particular to whatever 
needs the House has at the time. Many with peculiar skills or highly 
specific fields of expertise find themselves in the employ of 
dragonmarked houses or house members with eccentric interests and deep 
pockets.</p><p><b>Guilder</b>. Every dragonmarked house is more than a 
single family. Each house encompasses at least one guild that operates 
just like a traditional craft or trade guild, and hundreds of people 
associate with these guilds while having no other relationship to the 
houses that oversee them. The Guilder is among these, perhaps being a 
skilled physician or cleric in House Jorasco's Healers Guild, for 
example, or an inquisitive associated with House Tharashk's Finders 
Guild. The Guilder might have the guild artisan background or some other
 set of skills suited to the specialties of your patron house's guilds.</p><p><b>Heir</b>.
 The Heir is a member of your dragonmarked house patron, related by 
blood and carrying the house name. This character most likely chooses 
the race that matches the bloodline of the house. The Heir can be 
dragonmarked (with the appropriate marked subrace or racial variant) or 
unmarked. The house agent background (described in this chapter) proves 
particularly appropriate for this character.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="216" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">House Missions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p72</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your
 group and your DM should decide together which house employs you. The 
nature of the missions you undertake depends in part on the house or 
guild you work for, but there are general categories of work that every 
house needs agents to perform on its behalf. The House Missions table 
provides suggestions for which house might employ you along with

 emerged this week of bitter disputes within the Twelve, the arcane 
institution that supposedly embodies the spirit of cooperation among the
 houses. According to a source that wished to remain anonymous, a 
special meeting of the Committee of Twelve was called last week to 
address accusations that researchers connected to House Kundarak had 
been diverting funds from the institute's budget to fund their own 
private projects, then concealing the results of those projects from 
their colleagues. Kundarak's representative, according to our source, 
denied the accusations, saying that the researchers are operating within
 their allotted budget and keeping their results secret only 
temporarily, as a matter of house security.</p><p>This matter is far 
from resolved, as the council meeting devolved into shouted arguments 
before disbanding. Representatives of House Medani and House Tharashk 
were particularly vocal in denouncing Kundarak, leaving this reporter to
 wonder whether a schism within the Council of Twelve might be 
imminent—and what that might mean for peaceful relations among the 
dragonmarked houses themselves.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>The
 Twelve facilitates communication and cooperation among the dragonmarked
 houses. As part of the agreements that ended the War of the Mark, the 
houses agreed to create an institute for the application of magic—a 
foundation that would study dragonmarks, along with more traditional 
forms of magic. Over the centuries, the Twelve has been responsible for 
many magical advances, including the airships operated by House Lyrandar
 and the message stations of House Sivis</p><p>As an arm of the 
dragonmarked houses, the Twelve attempted to remain neutral during the 
Last War, but many of its wizards and artificers had national loyalties 
that were stronger than their ties to the institute. Now that the Twelve
 has resumed normal operations, it seeks to replace its lost members and
 make sure that each house is represented.</p><p>While the Twelve 
provides a way for your group to work for multiple dragonmarked houses, 
its goals and benefits are similar to those of an individual house. 
Consider using the following details as a template if there's a 
particular dragonmarked house you wish to serve.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="225" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patronage.</span></span> <p>As
 a patron, the Twelve is functionally similar to a dragonmarked house. 
Rather than advancing one house's interests, though, the Twelve seeks to
 advance magical developments that have practical value to society as 
well as potential for profit. All the houses contribute to the operating
 budget of the institute, and in theory they all benefit from the 
results of its research.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>As
 agents of the Twelve, you might undertake missions intended to help one
 house at a time or all of them at once, typically with a focus on 
magical research or problem-solving. Members of your group might have 
different status within their houses, but within the Twelve you're held 
as equals. The Twelve pay you (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4,patron%20benefits,0">Patron Benefits</a>"),
 and as their agents, you receive a 5 percent discount on services from 
all the dragonmarked houses (rather than a 10 percent discount from one 
house).</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="226" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Leadership.</span></span> <p>The

 Mark of Shadow is represented by two different houses, and House 
Cannith is currently fragmented into three branches, each of which has

 Twelve is headquartered in a many-spired keep that floats in the air

			</div></div><p></p><p><b>Dragonmarked Houses</b>. Above all, the 
Twelve has the almost universal support of the dragonmarked houses, 
which provide the funding to support its continued operation. One of the
 few things that all the houses agree on is that the Twelve should be 
allowed to do its work in peace. Agents of the Twelve can count on at 
least a minimal level of assistance from the houses in case of dire 
need.</p><p><b>King Kaius</b>. Not every nation shares the same goodwill
 toward the Twelve, but the institutes's location above the city of 
Korth makes its relationship with Karrnath particularly important. The 
kings of Karrnath have regularly sought council from the Twelve, and 
Kaius has not abandoned this practice. Agents of Karrnath's government 
are inclined to trust agents of the Twelve and side with them in times 
of trouble.</p><p><b>Manifest Institute</b>. In the city of Sharn, the 
Twelve sponsors the research of a number of scholars who make a study of
 the manifest zone that links the city to the plane of Syrania. Loosely 
organized as the Manifest Institute, these researchers include 
representatives from House Cannith, House Lyrandar, House Orien, and 
others, as well as those who work directly for the Twelve. The institute
 evaluates ways that the manifest zone might improve life in Sharn, 
seeks a deeper understanding of manifest zones in general, and plans 
contingencies in the event that the manifest zone ever evaporates.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="229" data-title-relative-index="2"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>Most
 enemies of the Twelve are individuals with grudges against the 
institute, which often stem from hurt feelings over being excluded from 
it. Those noted here number among the Twelve's fiercest foes:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Arcane Congress</b>.
 Established by King Galifar I expressly to serve as a political answer 
to the Twelve, the Arcane Congress competes with the Twelve over 
resources and students. Some would argue that the ongoing rivalry 
encourages both institutions toward more and better arcane discoveries, 
but the animosity sometimes escalates to sabotage and researchers taking
 excessive risks.</p><p><b>Mordain the Fleshweaver</b>. Not many 
personal grudges jeopardize the Twelve, but when a powerful wizard feels
 slighted, the impact can be significant. The elf wizard Mordain was 
banished from the Twelve more than two centuries ago because of his 
disturbing experiments related to the magic of the daelkyr. He dwells in
 Droaam now, focused on his research and plotting revenge. His reach 
isn't long, but agents of the Twelve avoid Droaam if at all possible.</p></div></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="230" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Espionage Agency</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p75</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Secret
 agents, spies, undercover operatives—your group is part of an 
organization engaged in espionage. Most such agencies are attached to 
governments or dragonmarked houses, gathering information on the 
activities and plans of rival nations, houses, and businesses. 
Naturally, your affiliation with an espionage agency is a secret; you 
can't advertise that connection, and if you get in trouble with law 
enforcement forces (especially in foreign nations), your home nation 
will disavow you and deny any knowledge of your activities.</p><p>It's 
said the Last War was fought as much by spies as by armies. Espionage 
agencies in every nation sought secrets to bring military supremacy to 
their own lands and provide dominance over their neighbors. In the years
 since the end of the war, a clandestine struggle among these agencies 
(which the <i>Korranberg Chronicle</i> dubbed the Shadow War) has continued unabated, just outside of the public eye.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="231" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">King's Dark Lanterns</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p76</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 King's Dark Lanterns is the intelligence division of the King's 
Citadel, an organization sworn to defend Breland from its enemies and 
dispense justice in the name of King Boranel. As the secret servants of 
the crown, members of the organization are granted the authority to 
conduct intelligence operations on foreign soil, execute covert missions
 across the globe, and prevent national secrets from falling into the 
hands of rival intelligence agencies. The Dark Lanterns also have an 
unwritten license to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation,
 its sovereign, or its citizens.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="232" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Headquarters.</span></span> <p>The
 King's Citadel is based in Breland's capital city of Wroat, under the 
command of the king's brother, Lord Kor ir'Wynarn. A changeling named 
Captain Vron serves as the leader of the Dark Lanterns, with four 
subordinate knights marshal leading branch offices across Breland, in 
Sharn, Starilaskur, and Xandrar. A much smaller branch office keeps an 
eye on Brelish interests in the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Small, 
temporary field offices are sometimes established to coordinate missions
 outside Breland; these offices double as safe houses for agents in 
trouble, and they are designed to be wiped clean at a moment's notice if
 discovered by local authorities.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The
 Sharn office of the King's Citadel is in Andith Tower in the Ambassador
 Towers district. Though a knight marshal commands the office, most of 
the King's Citadel members in Sharn are Dark Lanterns, and thus under 
the authority of a scheming and ruthless gnome named Talleon Haliar 
Tonan.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 King's Dark Lanterns includes more than 500 agents operating within 
Breland's borders and roughly one-fifth that number stationed abroad. 
They often work in teams, and also work closely with the other divisions
 of the Citadel. Sometimes they recruit local talent, often under false 
pretenses, to help them accomplish their missions in foreign lands.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="234" data-title-relative-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Allies.</span></span> <p>By
 their nature, espionage agencies must be cautious in choosing their 
allies, and the King's Dark Lanterns is no exception. Its most 
trustworthy allies include the following facets of the Brelish 
government:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>King Boranel</b>.
 The King's Dark Lanterns, as one would expect, serve the king of 
Breland, and he is their greatest advocate and ally. The king views 
loyalty as mutual: as long as an agent's loyalty is irreproachable, 
Boranel is willing to exercise his considerable power on that agent's 
behalf.</p><p><b>The King's Citadel</b>. The Citadel has three branches 
besides the Dark Lanterns. The King's Swords are elite special combat 
forces. The King's Shields protect the king and his closest family 
members and associates. The King's Wands provide magical support to the 
other branches of the Citadel as well as other Brelish forces. Some Dark
 Lanterns might think themselves superior to members of the other 
branches, but even so they recognize other Citadel agents as players on 
the same team. When your group needs a little extra help, the other 
branches of the Citadel are there for you.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="235" data-title-relative-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>Rare
 is the espionage agency that is loved. Even within Breland, the 
populace views the Dark Lanterns with suspicion, and powerful people 
outside the royal family harbor resentment at the influence of the 
Citadel. Many people and institutions outside Breland view the Dark 
Lanterns as a hostile force. As a result, the following groups account 
for just a few enemies of the Dark Lanterns:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Brelish Populists</b>.
 As much as King Boranel is loved in his country, many Brelish voices 
argue that the era of monarchy is at an end, and the throne of Breland 
should be replaced by a government democratically elected by the 
citizenry. When these forces grow restless enough to plot and riot, the 
Citadel—and often the Dark Lanterns—work to bring them to heel. As a 
result, those who question the authority of the king are the most likely
 Brelish citizens to mistrust the Dark Lanterns or view them with open 
hostility. According to rumor some of those people even hold high 
positions in the Brelish government.</p><p><b>Foreign Nations</b>. Every
 nation knows the King's Dark Lanterns serves as an espionage force and 
do their best to track the movements of Dark Lantern agents within their
 borders. Foreign governments treat Dark Lantern agents with care to 
avoid sparking an international incident, but they are quick to arrest 
Dark Lantern agents suspected of wrongdoing.</p><p><b>New Cyre</b>. One 
of the world's largest concentrations of Cyran refugees settled in 
eastern Breland under the leadership of Oargev ir'Wynarn, the last 
prince of Cyre. Many voices among the Cyrans, possibly including Oargev 
himself, call for the establishment of an independent nation in what is 
now Brelish territory, but Boranel is determined to hold on to every 
acre of his land. The Dark Lanterns actively infiltrate the Cyran 
refugee community, rooting out those who would act against the king.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="236" data-title-relative-index="2"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p77</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>You gain the following benefits when your group's patron is an espionage agency:</p><p><b>Assignments</b>.
 Your agency might assign you specific tasks at any time, at the DM's 
discretion. You have wide latitude regarding how you carry out a task, 
and your assignments can sometimes be very broad and require 
considerable time to complete.</p><p><b>Expense Account</b>. You have 
access to an account maintained at the banks of House Kundarak. You can 
use this account to pay your daily living expenses, as well as for 
purchasing anything you need for completing your missions—equipment, 
transportation, bribes, and so on. Your normal spending limit is 100 gp 
per month for each member of your group. If you exceed that, your agency
 asks you to account for the month's expenses, and they might require 
you to pay back the excess if you can't justify it (at the DM's 
discretion). You can't carry over an unused amount from one month to the
 next, and your access to this account can be cut off at any time if you
 abuse it or fall out of the agency's good graces. The agency is aware 
of every time you access the account and where you are when you do so.</p><p><b>Identification</b>.
 Your agency provides you with identification papers establishing your 
true identity, and you also have ready access to false papers and 
matching travel documents showing different identities, when you need 
them for a mission. (Any time you enter a foreign nation, it is a good 
idea for you to do so under a false identity.)</p><p><b>Powerful Friends</b>.
 An espionage agency, by nature, has a long reach and a lot of power to 
make things happen behind the scenes. You can call in a favor for a wide
 range of benefits: A legal case against you might be suddenly dropped. A
 rival might disappear. A much-needed magic item might be delivered to 
you. These favors can provide significant short-term benefit, but they 
can also come with equally significant long-term repercussions—which 
might lead to entirely new missions.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="237" data-title-relative-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Build Your Group</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p77</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Espionage
 agents are typically both highly trained and tightly specialized. The 
type of missions you undertake can shape your group's composition; you 
might be a team of hunters or investigators, focused on tracking people 
down or gathering information. More likely, you're a diverse team with a
 range of skills that allow you undertake a variety of different 
missions on your patron's behalf. Consider some or all of these roles 
for the characters in your party:</p><p><b>Chameleon</b>. A master of 
disguise, sleight of hand, and deception, the Chameleon can perform the 
work of the Investigator or a Confiscator right under a target's nose—or
 provide cover to agents with different specialties as they do their 
jobs. A high Charisma, proficiency with the disguise kit (or access to 
spells that cloak or disguise one's appearance), and proficiency with 
skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="performance_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Performance</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="sleight%20of%20hand_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Sleight of Hand</span>
 all greatly benefit the Chameleon. Bards and rogues, as well as 
characters with the charlatan, entertainer, or urchin background, often 
excel in this role.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="238" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Breland Ledger—Lies on trial! karrn Spy faces justice</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p78</span></span><p>In

 Sometimes an espionage agency needs something stolen—a document that 
incriminates a public figure to a prototype war machine. The Confiscator
 has the key skills for such jobs. A good Dexterity score proves helpful
 in undertaking such tasks, especially if it's enhanced with proficiency
 with thieves' tools and the <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="sleight%20of%20hand_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Sleight of Hand</span> and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="stealth_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Stealth</span> skills. Confiscators are often rogues, and many have a history of stealing for profit rather than national interest.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>.
 The Hunter stalks humanoid prey, for purposes of assassination, 
abduction, or gathering information. A combination of combat prowess 
with stealth and interaction skills makes for well-prepared Hunters. 
Rangers and rogues prove particularly adept at this role, as might 
anyone with proficiency in the <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="perception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Perception</span> and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="stealth_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Stealth</span> skills. A high Charisma and proficiency in <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span> skills can also be useful. Hunters often come from backgrounds such as outlander or urchin.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>. The Investigator is the archetypal spy, a master of deductive reasoning and suave interaction. Naturally, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>
 can be a crucial skill, which many characters in this role combine with
 magical means of scrying to learn about their enemies and objectives. 
Bards and wizards make natural Investigators, especially if they can 
acquire one or more skills from among <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="perception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Perception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="stealth_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Stealth</span>. Investigators come from backgrounds as varied as charlatans, nobles, sages, and urchins.</p><p><b>Operator</b>.
 An Operator leads or organizes a team of agents in the field. Like a 
military officer, the Operator issues orders and bears responsibility 
for the agents on the team. High Charisma and Intelligence scores help 
make the Operator a strong leader, especially in conjunction with skill 
proficiencies such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span> and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>.
 The wide array of skills used by other agents are also valuable to the 
Operator, who might end up stepping into a different role when the need 
arises. The Operator is often a bard and might come from a soldier or 
noble background (being accustomed to leadership in one form or 
another).</p><p><b>Saboteur</b>. The Saboteur interferes with the 
functioning of enemy assets. More than a reckless bomber, they combine a
 willingness to destroy with a knack for infiltration. Proficiency with 
thieves' tools and in skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="stealth_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Stealth</span>
 often serve the work of sabotage. The Saboteur benefits from an 
understanding of craft and magic items, making artificers particularly 
skilled in this role. Guild artisans might also disguise tools of 
destruction as mundane objects or works of art. Many Saboteurs come from
 backgrounds such as charlatans or soldiers.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="239" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Types of Espionage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p78</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Espionage
 activities can be classified in three broad categories:

 nation has some form of espionage agency, and two of the dragonmarked 
houses (House Phiarlan and House Thuranni) include specialized espionage
 forces as part of their businesses. Besides the King's Dark Lanterns, 
some of Khorvaire's more prominent espionage agencies include the 
following groups:</p><p><b>Argentum</b>. The Argentum is a ministry 
within the Church of the Silver Flame. Originally dedicated to the 
acquisition, study, and redistribution of magic items and artifacts, it 
was repurposed during the Last War to serve as Thrane's espionage 
agency.</p><p><b>Royal Eyes</b>. Aundair is renowned for its wizards, 
and the Royal Eyes of Aundair excel at spellcraft and divination—almost 
every agent of the Royal Eyes has an arcane advantage. Agents spy on 
other nations, pursue notorious criminals, and engage in a host of other
 wand-and-dagger missions for the crown.</p><p><b>Serpentine Table</b>. 
The Serpentine Table is the espionage arm of House Phiarlan. Few people 
outside the house even know of its existence, and hardly any of its 
lower-level operatives realize the full implication of their service. 
They simply collect and pass along information, never knowing how it is 
used.</p><p><b>The Trust</b>. Zilargo's secret police, the Trust 
maintains order in the service of the Triumvirate. This web of spies and
 ruthless assassins are known for their operations in Zilargo, but few 
realize that the Trust is also active in nations across Khorvaire. The 
gnomes believe knowledge is the greatest weapon of all, and Trust agents
 endlessly search for secrets that could prove useful to their nation.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="248" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Head of State</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p79</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your

 disaster of the Mourning wiped out much of the population of Cyre, but 
those living near the western border had time to cross into the Brelish 
countryside ahead of the strange wall of gray mist that now shrouds the 
Mournland. King Boranel of Breland took pity on the refugees and 
established camps for them, camps which have now grown into the town of 
New Cyre.</p><p>The mayor of New Cyre is Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn, the 
last son of Cyre's ruling family. He was serving as an ambassador to 
Breland at the time of the Mourning, and Cyran refugees across Khorvaire
 now look to him for leadership as a sort of king in exile. He hopes to 
one day gather all of Cyre's displaced children to a rebuilt Cyre.</p><p>Prince
 Oargev is obsessed with the Mourning. He is desperate to discover the 
truth behind the destruction of his country. He regularly seeks 
information from those who venture into the Mournland, and he funds 
expeditions into the remains of his once-proud nation, hoping to 
discover some clue as to the cause of Cyre's demise.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="250" data-title-relative-index="4"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Allies.</span></span> <p>Prince
 Oargev has a gift for diplomacy (and a number of talented ambassadors 
in his employ), which has enabled a widespread campaign of outreach to 
Cyran refugees across Khorvaire. He has a great deal of popular 
sympathy, as well as allies in every nation, including the following 
groups and individuals:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>King Boranel</b>.
 The ruler of Breland did a great kindness to the people of Cyre by 
establishing the refugee camps that have grown into New Cyre. Oargev has
 not forgotten that kindness, and he would prefer not to jeopardize his 
friendship with Boranel by seizing land from Breland. However, rumors 
persist that Oargev plans to secede, and the King's Dark Lanterns 
frequently send agents into New Cyre to keep an eye on anti-Brelish 
sentiment. Oargev wisely views Boranel as an ally, but knows Breland 
could be a threat.</p><p><b>Q'barra</b>. Aside from New Cyre, the 
largest population of Cyran refugees resides in Q'barra. Oargev has 
invited these displaced Cyrans to join him in New Cyre, but most of them
 have started putting down new roots in the jungle land. If Cyre could 
be reclaimed from the Mournland, many of them would probably return; in 
the meantime, they are a friendly force in the east, willing to offer 
shelter and aid to agents of Prince Oargev who find themselves among the
 settlements of Q'barra.</p><p><b>Refugees</b>. Cyrans live across 
Khorvaire in the wake of the Last War. Oargev does significant work in 
reaching out to his displaced subjects, and the majority of them 
sympathize with his goals and aid his agents.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="251" data-title-relative-index="4"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>Bitter
 Cyran avengers who punish those they believe responsible for the 
Mourning have cast shadows on Prince Oargev's reputation. As a result, 
the following groups consider Prince Oargev their foe:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>The Five Nations</b>.
 Aundairians, Karrns, and Thranes are generally unsympathetic to the 
plight of displaced Cyrans. Many of them bitterly bear the scars of the 
war, their resentments reinforced by the deeds of violent Cyran 
extremists. Even the Brelish, for all their practiced indifference, 
become guarded when confronted by Cyrans, who represent a burden foisted
 upon them by their leaders. They tend to treat Cyran refugees as 
second-class citizens and vagabonds. Among non-Cyran communities, agents
 of Prince Oargev can't rely on aid from any of Cyre's former enemies.</p><p><b>The Lord of Blades.</b> In the depths of the Mournland, the closest thing to a sovereign is <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">the Lord of Blades</a>—a

agents no mercy.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="252" data-title-relative-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p80</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>With a head of state as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="253" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Voice of Breland—Pauper Prince Plots bandit barony</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p80</span></span><p>Prince
 Oargev, the exiled Cyran royal who governs the town of New Cyre by the 
sufferance of King Boranel, is planning a brazen act of secession, 
hoping to transform all of eastern Breland into a new Cyran realm, 
sources say. According to a group of adventurers recently employed by 
Oargev, the prince sent them into the Mournland to recover weapons of 
war so they could be wielded against the Brelish military during the 
secession. How will King Boranel respond to this treachery? Will the 
nations come to the defense of the displaced prince? Will Oargev's 
scheming result in all of eastern Breland being swathed in the same gray
 mist that consumed Cyre?</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Assignments</b>.
 Your work is performed at the direction of your patron. That means you 
are usually under assignment and not entirely free to choose your own 
course. Depending on the ruler and the task, these assignments can be 
directive or more hands-off, as you pursue long-term goals.</p><p><b>Expenses</b>.
 In addition to your salary, your patron reimburses you for 
extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required 
to account for your expenses and might be called on to explain any 
extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and 
most services don't draw a second glance.</p><p><b>Immunity</b>. As long
 as you remain in the head of state's good graces, you are nearly immune
 to prosecution under the laws of your home country. Committing serious 
crimes—especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the work 
you've been assigned—is a good way to fall out of your patron's good 
graces, however. When you are carrying out your orders within your 
nation's borders, though, you have a great deal of leeway in how you 
choose to do that, and the law isn't an obstacle. (However, note that 
agents of Prince Oargev can't necessarily expect the same clemency in 
Breland outside of New Cyre.)</p><p><b>Salary</b>. Your employment for a
 head of state brings you an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to 
maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, your salary might 
increase or decrease depending on which particular head of state you 
work for, the nature of your work, and the length of your employment.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="254" data-title-relative-index="4"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Build Your Group</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p80</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A

			</div></div><p></p><p><b>Civil Servant</b>. The vast majority of work
 performed on behalf of a head of state has very little to do with 
deadly adventure: it's about prosecuting and judging criminals in the 
courts of law, hearing the petitions and complaints of citizens, 
collecting taxes, and interminable amounts of paperwork. Once in a 
while, though, a faithful Civil Servant gets forcefully pulled from this
 work and thrust into life-or-death situations, with or without help 
from more hardened adventurers. The knowledge and experience of a Civil 
Servant can often be useful, with some developing skills as clerics, 
rogues, wizards, or other classes. Such characters often come from the 
sage background and have proficiency in skills that reflect their 
studies, such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="arcana_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Arcana</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="history_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">History</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="nature_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Nature</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="religion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Religion</span>.</p><p><b>Diplomat</b>.
 Negotiating treaties, de-escalating conflicts, and issuing ultimatums 
are tasks that fall within the purview of the Diplomat, who typically 
puts their high Charisma to work in the service of the state. These 
characters often come from a noble background and bring proficiency in 
skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span> and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span>
 to their work. Bards are natural fits in this role, as are paladins—as 
long as they aren't asked to do things that violate the tenets of their 
oaths.</p><p><b>Marshal</b>. Combat is the specialty of the Marshal, who
 focuses on enforcing the law of the land and bringing fugitives to 
justice. Fighters and paladins make natural Marshals, many being former 
soldiers who continue fighting the Last War in different venues. They 
often have reasonable Intelligence scores or proficiency in <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>.</p><p><b>Warden</b>.
 The Warden's focus isn't so much on the people of the nation, but on 
the land encompassed within its borders, both cultivated and wild. 
Sometimes that extends to protecting the border from incursions, but 
more often a Warden contend with monstrosities and wild beasts that 
threaten the populace, magical corruption that harms the land, and

 mysterious figure who appears in lofty myths and children's fables, 
Sora Kell extends her reach across the world and through the myriad 
planes, claiming mystical knowledge by force and cunning. A mighty 
wizard with magic worthy of epic tales, she is a monster whose 
adamantine claws can flense whole armies before any soldier can land a 
blow on her plated hide. Tales of Sora Kell claim she is the first night
 hag, born from Khyber in the first age of the world alongside the

pursue their own goals.</p><p>One fact is indisputable: Sora Kell is an

 some other immortal patrons, Sora Kell's physical form has not been

her daughters and watches events unfold. Maybe she is trapped upon 
another plane of existence or is devising magic that could shake the 
foundations of existence. In any case, she appears in the dreams of her

 a creature of legend, Sora Kell can hardly be said to have allies, 
except for a handful of other legends like the following groups:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Daughters of Sora Kell.</b>
 Sora Kell's three daughters—the gifted oracle Sora Teraza, the cunning 
trickster Sora Katra, and the vicious monster Sora Maenya—rule the 
nation of Droaam, either to facilitate their own scheming or at their 
mother's command. Adventurers who enjoy the patronage of Sora Kell can 
impose on her daughters for aid if they should ever find themselves in 
or near Droaam. They can also count on the aid of Daask, a criminal gang
 in Sharn, which is controlled by Sora Katra.</p><p><b>Lords of Dust</b>.
 Ancient fiends number among Sora Kell's allies—not the least of which 
are her daughters' three long-forgotten fathers. It isn't for Sora 
Kell's pawns to know which of the powerful villains are friendly to Sora
 Kell, but she occasionally sends adventurers to lend aid to 
rakshasas—often lesser fiends working to free the ancient overlords. 
Wise adventurers carefully weigh the rewards of working with such fiends
 against the costs—to themselves and the world.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="269" data-title-relative-index="5"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>Like
 most immortal beings, Sora Kell has many enemies, though the mortal 
ones barely merit her attention. For the most part, only beings like 
those that follow dare oppose Sora Kell:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>The Dreaming Dark</b>.
 In Sora Kell's estimation, the greatest threat to her are the quori of 
Dal Quor, and their minions, the Dreaming Dark. Fortunately for the 
adventurers that serve Sora Kell, few mortals register as worthy foes in
 the alien minds of the quori.</p><p><b>Lords of Dust</b>. Sora Kell has
 allies among the Lords of Dust, but she also has bitter rivals. Like 
the quori, these fiends rarely pay much attention to Sora Kell's mortal 
minions, but they aren't above harming mortal adventurers just to spite 
her.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="270" data-title-relative-index="4"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p83</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 patronage of an immortal being is a relationship built on favors, not 
on employment or service. Your group does favors for your patron, and 
you can ask favors in return. These favors are the benefits you gain for
 having an immortal being as your group's patron, and they might include
 any of the following boons:</p><p><b>Contacts</b>. Your group is almost
 certainly not the only one sponsored by your patron. Plans that span 
the world and the course of millennia require many agents to complete. 
If necessary, your patron can put you in contact with their other 
agents, who might be in a position to help you through status, 
influence, or magic.</p><p><b>Information</b>. The most precious reward 
most immortals can give is a tidbit of their ages-spanning knowledge. 
Immortal beings often know secrets hidden from most mortals—including 
glimpses of possible futures. They don't usually share secrets freely, 
but they might reward your group for the completion of a mission with a 
hint, a puzzle, or a morsel of information that sets you off in pursuit 
of more.</p><p><b>Magic</b>. Immortal beings often have access to vast 
stores of magic, including their own spells and secret caches of magic 
items. They are mindful of the value of this magic, and grant spells and
 items as rewards appropriate to the favor and the power of the 
adventurers.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="271" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Draconic Prophecy as Group Patron</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p84</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>Though
 it is not a sentient force that can control or reward your party, the 
Draconic Prophecy can be similar to an Immortal Being patron. The 
Prophecy can act as a guide for adventurers who seek to fulfill it—or to
 steer its fulfillment in a particular direction. You stand among the 
heroes of the present age; surely you have a role to play in the 
unfolding prophecy.</p><p>In order for the Draconic Prophecy to work as a
 patron, one or more of the characters needs to have access to words 
from the Prophecy. Your group might adventure to seek out places where 
the Prophecy is written: mountainsides and cavern walls, ancient text 
and crumbling ruins, or the patterns of moons, stars, and the Ring of 
Siberys (best interpreted at an observatory). A dragonmarked character 
might gain insight into the Prophecy from the marks on their skin. 
Alternatively, a character might hear words from the Prophecy in dreams 
or visions, or surfacing from some deeply buried memory of a traumatic 
event.</p><p>Given access to the words of the Prophecy, it's up to the 
characters to decide what they mean. The Prophecy is notoriously 
difficult to interpret, and a given passage might be fulfilled in 
different ways (or, possibly, in multiple ways over the course of 
centuries). For example, take a prophetic snippet like the one mentioned
 in the book's introduction: "If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful 
assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his 
nation." This might mean that if King Boranel of Breland is killed in 
the Mournland, the kingdom of Breland will be dissolved, and if 
dissolving the monarchy is the characters' goal, they can try to bring 
about those circumstances. On the other hand, it could mean that if an 
awakened bear in the Eldeen Reaches declares himself king of the forest,
 and if the bear is killed on the anniversary of the Mourning, the 
tallest tree in the domain he claimed (the Crown of his nation) will 
fall. If that is the characters' goal, for whatever reason, they might 
try to bring those circumstances about.</p><p>The currency of favors 
that defines most patronage relationships is tricky when your group's 
patron is a series of vague oracular verses rather than a person. 
However, bringing about the fulfillment of the Prophecy in a certain way
 often has immediate or long-term benefits that are equivalent to the 
favors another patron might grant your group. Toppling the Crown in the 
Bear King's domain might give you access to a spell inscribed in the 
ancient tree's rings, for example.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="272" data-title-relative-index="5"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Build Your Group</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p83</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>No
 common thread unites adventurers with an immortal patron, except 
perhaps uncommon openness to the mysterious and unknown. You haven't 
been chosen because of your capabilities; they might have been chosen to
 fulfill the words of a prophecy, because they were born at auspicious 
times and places, or because they happened to be in a particular place 
at a certain time. Individual characters in your group might have 
different relationships with your patron, though; consider some or all 
of these roles for your characters:</p><p><b>Agent</b>. The Agent 
doesn't receive direct communications from an immortal patron, but puts 
faith in the dreams and inspiration of others, following such omens with
 an eager heart. This character is under no illusions of having a 
special role to play in the immortal's grand plans, but is ready to make
 sure those with such roles play them. This is often a character with no
 magical ability or sometimes from a scholarly background, such as a 
sage or hermit—perhaps someone familiar with lore about the immortal but
 not directly inspired by it. Agents typically have proficiency in 
skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="arcana_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Arcana</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="history_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">History</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="religion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Religion</span>.</p><p><b>Innocent</b>.
 Some characters have no intention of becoming adventurers and desire no
 connection to the machinations of the immortals, but they get caught up
 in schemes and prophecies anyway. The Innocent might have been 
identified as a key part of a prophecy, or made what seemed like an 
innocent bargain with a harmless old hermit, or found an artifact with 
mysterious powers. The folk hero background is ideal for the Innocent, 
combining humble origins with a sense of destiny. Any class or 
proficiencies are suited for this role.</p><p><b>Visionary</b>. At least
 one character in the party should have a particular connection to your 
immortal patron. The Visionary might hear the patron's voice in dreams, 
see waking visions that convey the immortal's will, or interpret signs 
in accordance with prophecy. Different backgrounds might suggest 
different stories for a Visionary: An acolyte might have had a 
revelatory experience that paved the way for the immortal's 
communications. A hermit might have been plagued by disturbing dreams

 immortal beings exert their will upon the people and nations of 
Eberron. Many are villainous forces that adventurers might find 
themselves resisting, such as the fiends of the Lords of Dust or the 
Quori and the Dreaming Dark. Even those without evil motives are often 
inscrutable—the agendas of immortal beings spanning millennia. What role
 you might play in an immortal's schemes and what sorts of deeds you'll 
be called on to perform varies from patron to patron. Consider the 
following options when determining what immortal patron your party might
 serve:</p><p><b>Flamewind</b>. A gynosphinx with oracular powers came 
back to Morgrave University with a Xen'drik expedition two years ago, 
and took up residence there. In addition to her first-hand knowledge of 
Xen'drik, she is one of the few nondragons to have made extensive study 
of the Draconic Prophecy. She sometimes sends adventurers on missions by
 uttering a cryptic prophecy. "It is time for the Globe of Seven Lights 
to be brought out of Xen'drik," she might say. She never explains her 
proclamations, and never provides information on mundane affairs.</p><p><b>Faerie Court</b>.
 Somewhere deep in the western forest of the Eldeen Reaches lies the 
Twilight Demesne, where powerful archfey hold court over an ongoing 
revelry. It often appears as if nothing more than mischief and caprice 
governs the actions of the archfey, but they have ancient interests in 
the mortal world—as well as extensive rivalries among themselves.</p><p><b>Undying Court</b>.
 The honored, undead ancestors of Aerenal rule the elven nation and 
shape their people's destiny. These undead—known as deathless—despise 
evil undead, nurture an ancient grudge against dragons, and pursue the 
fulfillment of ancient prophecies.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="279" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Inquisitive Agency</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p85</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your
 party works for an agency offering investigative services, or you might
 run your own firm as a group. Inquisitives put their keen minds and 
dogged determination to use unraveling mysteries. Inquisitive agencies 
run the gamut from private investigators to networks of detectives 
supported by dragonmarked houses.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="280" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Finders Guild</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p85</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Across
 Khorvaire, the inquisitives of House Tharashk have a reputation for 
discretion and cunning. Members of that house operate the Finders Guild,
 a loose collection of independent inquisitive agencies. Dragonmarked 
heirs of House Tharashk own and operate some of these agencies, but each
 employs unmarked inquisitives as well, leaving the heirs free to take 
on the most difficult cases. A connection with the Finders Guild is 
viewed as a mark of high quality, a guarantee that a particular agency 
numbers among the best in the business.</p><p>In the city of Sharn 
alone, four inquisitives with the Mark of Finding lead agencies in 
different parts of the city: Kurt Karr'Aashta's Investigations in the 
neighborhood of Deathsgate, Information Acquisition in Underlook, 
Thuranne Velderan's Investigative Services in Warden Towers, and Globe 
Information Agency in Dragon Towers. Your party might be associated with
 any of these groups, or you might operate your own affiliated agency. 
In any case, your connection to the Finders Guild means you have a 
sterling reputation to uphold.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="281" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Aundairian Scroll—Genius Inquisitive serves cold justice</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p86</span></span><p>In

 the Finders' Guild's greatest strength is its internal connections, it 
lacks many strong allies beyond House Tharashk's holdings. That said, 
the following groups have had numerous interactions with the guild and 
generally view inquisitives in a positive light:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Droaam</b>.
 Since the rise of the Daughters of Sora Kell in Droaam, members of 
House Tharashk have served as intermediaries between the realm of 
monsters and the east, bartering the services of monstrous mercenaries 
across Khorvaire. The house takes great pride in having forced 
mainstream Khorvaire to recognize that orcs and half-orcs are worthy of 
the same courtesies and opportunities as races long established in 
society, and house members are now using their status to do the same for
 various other races from Droaam. As a result, members of the Finders' 
Guild can expect at least a modicum of respect while traveling in Droaam</p><p><b>Gatekeepers</b>.
 House Tharashk and the druidic sect of the Gatekeepers share common 
origins in the Shadow Marches, and the druids remain friendly with the 
house and its Finders' Guild. In the Marches, the guild often helps the 
druids locate stray aberrations and open portals between planes of 
existence. For their part, the Gatekeepers offer the support of their 
magic to aid guild members in whatever ways they can.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="283" data-title-relative-index="6"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>The
 work of inquisitives naturally creates enemies, mostly on a local 
scale: con artists, gangs, and others who have had their unsavory deeds 
uncovered. Such groups are inclined to hold grudges against the guild as
 a whole. The guild's enemies on a larger scale are few, but include the
 following groups.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Daask</b>.
 The Finders Guild has a difficult relationship with the criminal 
organization called Daask. On the one hand, Daask is a violent criminal 
gang whose members are often targeted by Finders Guild inquisitives. On 
the other hand, Daask is a gang of monsters, many of whom actually left 
Droaam under the auspices of House Tharashk. Finders Guild inquisitives 
who pry too deeply into Daask business often feel pressure to back away 
coming from higher in House Tharashk. Those who ignore that pressure 
tend to end up the targets of Daask assassins.</p><p><b>House Deneith</b>.
 For centuries, House Deneith cornered the market on mercenary forces in
 Khorvaire. It was an unpleasant surprise for them when House Tharashk 
entered the mercenary market in the later days of the war, bringing 
monsters from Droaam to bolster Five Nations armies. House Deneith still
 resents House Tharashk for this, and the animosity between the houses 
only increases when Finders' Guild inquisitives stick their noses into 
Sentinel Marshal business.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="284" data-title-relative-index="5"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p86</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>With an inquisitive agency as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:</p><p><b>Compensation</b>.
 You can collect fees from your clients when you undertake 
investigations on their behalf. You can set those fees, and clients will
 often pay higher fees as your reputation and prestige increase. A fee 
of 5 sp to 10 sp per inquisitive per day, plus expenses incurred as part
 of the investigation, is a reasonable starting rate.</p><p><b>Contacts</b>.
 Through the Finders' Guild, each associated inquisitive agency can 
benefit from the knowledge and experience of not only other 
inquisitives, but also bounty hunters, explorers, dragonshard 
prospectors, and others who make use of House Tharashk's talent for 
finding. Thus, an affiliated agency might find helpful allies not only 
in cities throughout the Five Nations, but even in remote corners of the
 wilderness where trackers and prospectors ply their trade. At the DM's 
discretion, your contacts might direct you to new cases, offer you leads
 in the case you're working on, put you in touch with their own network 
of contacts, or show up suddenly to pull you out of the fire. You can 
call in a favor from your agency to draw on the resources of any of your
 contacts. At the start of the campaign, roll twice on the Contacts 
table to choose two contacts. You will certainly acquire new contacts in
 the course of your adventures, who might or might not fit the 
descriptions of contacts on this table.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="285">Contacts</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 wide variety of talents can be useful in the work of an inquisitive, 
leading the Finders' Guild to employ specialists with diverse skill 
sets. Many inquisitives come from backgrounds such as criminal, sage, 
soldier, or urchin, regardless of the role they play in a group. 
Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:</p><p><b>Client</b>.
 When a routine investigation goes sideways, sometimes innocents get 
unwillingly caught in the action. The common artisan who hired the party
 to find her missing partner might find herself and her hired 
inquisitives on the run when things take a deadly turn. Such a Client is
 often a nonplayer character whose connection with the party is 
dissolved at the end of an adventure, but sometimes a Client develops a 
taste for excitement and becomes a fixture in the campaign. A perfectly 
ordinary background such as guild artisan or folk hero often work well 
with this character, who otherwise needs no specific proficiencies or 
capabilities.</p><p><b>Consultant</b>. Sometimes skilled individuals end
 up working alongside inquisitives for a time. Such Consultants might 
work for a newspaper, study an esoteric field, or write crime fiction 
for a living. This character is usually similar to an Investigator, but 
typically has an unusual background or expert knowledge. The 
relationship between a Consultant and the rest of the party can be a 
source of drama—or comedy.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 prove helpful in this role. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers have both 
the requisite talents and the ability to supplement their interrogations
 with magic.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>. Investigators piece evidence

 high Intelligence score with proficiency in skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="investigation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Investigation</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="perception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Perception</span>, and sometimes <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="medicine_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Medicine</span>.
 The Investigator might also use divination and other forms of magic to 
supplement those skills, making wizards a natural fit for this role.</p><p><b>Tough</b>.
 An inquisitive's work is inherently dangerous, so it's often important 
for their group to include someone who can physically intervene when 
situations devolve into combat. The Tough's role might include fighting 
criminal thugs, kicking in doors, and even roughing up suspects, all of 
which suggests a high Strength score and combat ability.

 of the work done by inquisitives is relatively mundane: collecting 
evidence of marital infidelity, investigating insurance fraud, or 
finding runaways. Sometimes these relatively innocent investigations can
 lead into the shadowy underbelly of society and become more dangerous, 
but most adventurers prefer the more dangerous kinds of inquisitive

 Part spy, part inquisitive, and part soldier, the agents of the King's 
Citadel serve crown and country as the ultimate agency for dispensing 
the king's justice in Breland. Local watches and constabularies can call
 on its agents when a crime or situation poses a threat that spreads 
beyond their jurisdiction.</p><p><b>Sentinel Marshals</b>. The Sentinel 
Marshals are a multinational force administered by House Deneith and 
authorized to enforce the law across Khorvaire. As the only force that 
can cross borders in pursuit of fugitives, they are well trained to 
track renegades.</p><p><b>Sharn Watch</b>. Like most local police forces
 of any size, the Sharn Watch includes inquisitives devoted to solving 
crimes and tracking down the perpetrators.</p><p><b>Warning Guild</b>. 
Affiliated with but largely independent from House Medani, the Warning 
Guild provides certification and contract employment for bodyguards, 
inquisitives, and sentries across Khorvaire. The guild emphasizes the 
use of logic, perception, and deduction to assemble fragments of 
evidence into a recognizable whole. Its inquisitives are often called 
upon to solve mysteries that baffle local law enforcement.</p><p><b>Running Your Own</b>.
 Rather than join an existing inquisitive agency, you can start your 
own. You need to establish your own office. You can collect the same 
fees as if you worked for another agency, and you have access to the 
same range of contacts. You can also use the Running a Business downtime
 activity to direct the activities of your agency, as described at the 
start of this section.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="294" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Military Force</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p88</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Your
 group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger military force, one 
dedicated to combat missions or other dangerous tasks. You could be a 
team of mercenaries, a special forces unit, or an ordinary squad of 
infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from monsters, or even 
continue to fight the Last War in the shadows. There is plenty of work 
for military forces at the edges of civilization, such as protecting the
 Eldeen Reaches from the dangers of the Demon Marches or skirmishing 
with Droaam at the borders of Breland.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="295" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Redcloak Battalion</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p88</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion number among the deadliest warriors 
in Breland. When a situation calls for extreme military force, law 
enforcers turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought at the 
forefront of the Last War, and Brelish bards still sing of the exploits 
of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the
 battalion was split up and its units assigned to cities and strongholds
 across Breland.</p><p>As an elite group of special forces, the 
Redcloaks don't include inexperienced adventurers in their ranks. 
Considering that, there are two ways to use the Redcloak Battalion as a 
group patron.</p><p>First, the Redcloaks do sometimes take inexperienced
 adventurers under their wings. Existing Redcloaks proved themselves on 
the battlefields of the Last War; if the group is to continue, the 
Redcloaks of the future have to learn the soldier's trade in different 
battles. To such ends, senior members of the battalion send your party 
on missions across Khorvaire to provide you with combat experience as 
well as to further Redcloak goals.</p><p>Alternatively, your DM might 
decide to start the campaign with your characters at a higher level and 
already established as members of the Redcloaks (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,1,starting%20at%20higher%20level,0">Starting at Higher Level</a>" in chapter 1 of the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).
 In this case, you might also begin with magic items and other gear 
reflecting your status in the organization. The standard-issue uniform 
for the Redcloaks is a hooded crimson <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#cloak%20of%20protection_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="cloak%20of%20protection_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">cloak of protection</a>

 part of Breland's military forces, the Redcloaks can count on the 
support of the crown, the King's Citadel, and the larger Brelish army, 
largely summarized as the following parties:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

		</div></div><p></p><p><b>King Boranel</b>. The king of Breland is a 
cautious advocate of the Redcloaks. He values their contributions but 
fears their power, which is why he divided the battalion after the end 
of the war. Still, he rewards loyalty among the Redcloaks by showing 
loyalty to them in return. Again and again, he has proven himself 
willing to exercise his power on behalf of a loyal Redcloak.</p><p><b>Other Redcloaks</b>.
 The first place any Redcloak turns for help is another Redcloak. No one
 else is as reliable and competent, while being unerringly faithful to 
the Brelish king and the battalion. Every Redcloak readily provides aid 
to other members, with no questions asked and no favor expected in 
return.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="297" data-title-relative-index="7"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>As
 veterans of the Last War, many Redcloaks carry strong grudges against 
other nations. They tend to believe that the Treaty of Thronehold is 
merely an intermission in the ongoing conflict, and soon enough King 
Boranel will take his proper place on the throne of a reunited Galifar. 
Many of these grudges are personal based on an individual soldier's 
experience in the war, but some of them run both ways. Among the 
Redcloaks, tensions still run hot regarding their former rivals, 
particularly those from the following nations:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Darguun</b>.
 The hobgoblins of Darguun fought alongside Brelish forces at the Battle
 of Cairn Hill, but the cordial relations between the two nations frayed
 immediately after. The Redcloaks skirmished with hobgoblins who were 
leading Thrane civilians in chains back to Darguun. Few Darguuls 
remember the skirmish itself, but the "wicked red-cloaked Brelish" have 
an established place in the goblinoids' collective memory—and many 
Redcloaks do remember the event bitterly.</p><p><b>Thrane</b>. In the 
waning years of the Last War, the Redcloaks played a major role in the 
devastating Battle of Cairn Hill between Brelish and Thrane forces. 
Thanks to heavy losses on both sides, veterans of that battle tend to 
nurse bitter grudges against their enemies.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="298" data-title-relative-index="6"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p89</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>With a military force as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:</p><p><b>Accommodations</b>.
 You can always find a place to stay and meals on a base or fort 
connected to your military force. Your accommodations are appropriate to
 your rank and station, but never luxurious.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="299" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Newthrone Ledger—Thirteen dead in Blackscale Slaughter!</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p90</span></span><p>Venturing
 unusually far from their accustomed territory in the eastern jungles, a
 band of enormous lizardfolk—described by local experts as members of 
the Blackscale Tribe—broke through the fortifications at Adderport and 
killed thirteen residents before retreating back into the jungles. 
Khalar d'Tharashk has announced a plan to track the perpetrators and 
exact retribution under the sponsorship of King Sebastes.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Armory</b>.
 You can purchase nonmagical weapons and armor at a 20 percent discount 
at a facility associated with your military force. This might also be a 
location where you can buy magic items, at the DM's discretion, but you 
receive no discount.</p><p><b>Chain of Command</b>. You are part of a 
rigid chain of command. In addition to providing you with orders, this 
structure reduces your responsibility for your own actions. If you land 
in trouble in your own nation, you answer to your officers, not local 
law enforcement.</p><p><b>Orders</b>. You undertake your missions at the
 direction of a commanding officer. Your absolute obedience is expected.
 These missions are often explicit, leading you into the path of 
adventure. In some cases, though, you might be trusted with more 
open-ended tasks that afford you more leeway in interpreting orders.</p><p><b>Salary</b>.
 Each member of your group is paid a regular salary. The amount varies 
depending on your organization and your position within it, but at 
minimum you enjoy a modest lifestyle. You might receive a small salary 
(as little as 1 sp per day) but also receive food and housing on a 
military base. Or you could receive 1 gp per day but rely on that money 
for room and board. With higher rank comes commensurately higher pay. As
 an officer, you can maintain a comfortable lifestyle.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="300" data-title-relative-index="7"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Build Your Group</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p90</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 military unit, like most adventuring parties, incorporates a range of 
useful skills while covering each member's weaknesses with another's 
strengths. Thus, characters of any class can find a home in such a unit,
 and a diversity of different skills and backgrounds benefits the group 
as a whole. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your 
party:</p><p><b>Commander</b>. Every band of infantry has its leader, 
even if that person isn't a officer. The Commander earns that position 
through some combination of high Charisma and Intelligence—the ability 
to inspire and the capacity to plan. Proficiency in skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span> and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="history_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">History</span>
 can be helpful as well. The Commander might be a career soldier (with 
that background) or someone from a noble background placed in command by
 virtue of birth. A Commander might be a fighter, bard, cleric, paladin,
 or even wizard—as magic proves valuable in military engagements.</p><p><b>Medic</b>.
 Keeping soldiers alive is essential to military success, and that's the
 Medic's job. In an elite unit of adventurers, the Medic is often a 
cleric or has another class with healing ability, but these characters 
are also often proficient in the <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="medicine_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Medicine</span> skill or use of a <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#herbalism%20kit_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="herbalism%20kit_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">herbalism kit</a>.
 A Medic can be a soldier who demonstrated aptitude in healing and got 
moved into this position, or a character from a different background 
(such as acolyte, sage, or even hermit) who decided to put medical 
expertise to military use.</p><p><b>Scout</b>. Trained in navigating the
 wilderness and laying ambushes for enemy soldiers, the Scout melds the 
combat skill of a fighter with the skills of a ranger or rogue. High 
Dexterity and Wisdom scores, combined with proficiency in the <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="nature_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Nature</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="perception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Perception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="stealth_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Stealth</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="survival_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Survival</span>
 skills, support this character's core capabilities. Scouts are often 
recruited from people who are more familiar with the wilds than with 
city streets, including folk heroes, hermits, and outlanders.</p><p><b>Soldier</b>.
 Soldiers make up the core of most military groups, whether they're 
general infantry, magical artillery, or elite special forces. These 
characters come from all classes and backgrounds—for some, their 
background before joining the military is more important than their 
current role. No particular set of talents is common to all soldiers, 
but military units often strive to avoid duplication of skills.</p><p><b>Warforged</b>.
 Literally made for war, most warforged characters have spent the years 
since the end of the Last War trying to find a new way of life. For some
 warforged, the answer is to continue fighting the war one way or 
another, often as part of an organized military unit. This experience, 
as a people created to fulfill a role and now seemingly locked into a 
destructive destiny, is just a part of life for many warforged.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="301" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Military Missions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p90</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 work involved in serving as a military unit is wide-ranging. Your

during the Last War, so your group's missions influence the war effort

 nation in Khorvaire has its military forces. In addition to the 
Redcloak Battalion, the following groups number among the forces most 
likely to make use of a team of adventurers:</p><p><b>Blademarks Guild</b>.
 House Deneith manages mercenary activities across Khorvaire through its
 Blademarks Guild, with house members serving as officers, trainers, and
 strategists. The rank-and-file soldiers of the guild are largely human 
mercenaries but also includes significant numbers of hobgoblins from 
Darguun, elves from Valenar, and Cyran soldiers who no longer have a 
nation to fight for.</p><p><b>Maruk Ghaash'kala</b>. Among the orc 
tribes of the Demon Wastes, the Maruk tribe inhabits the deadly 
Labyrinth that lies between the wastes and the Eldeen Reaches. In its 
sacred dedication to containing the threat of the Lords of Dust, it 
draws significant numbers of orc barbarians from the Shadow Marches, 
human scouts from the Eldeen Reaches, and even youths from the Carrion 
Tribes that live deeper in the wastes.</p><p><b>Q'barra</b>. The 
frontier nation of Q'barra has significant need for military forces to 
protect its communities from the lizardfolk, warbands from Valenar, 
Lhazaar marauders, and other dangers of the jungle.</p><p><b>Valenar</b>.
 The elves of Valenar have no interest in peace, but they participated 
in the talks that led to the Treaty of Thronehold to gauge the measure 
of their enemies and gain acceptance in the human courts. Today, Valenar
 forces continue to raid the Talenta Plains and Q'barra on a regular 
basis, in stark defiance of the Treaty of Thronehold. A Valenar warband 
is unlikely to contain members of races other than elves and perhaps 
half-elves, but such a band could make an interesting military party.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="310" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Running Your Own.</span></span> <p>Rather than join an existing force, you might choose to form your own mercenary outfit.

 Thanks to its unflinching and mostly unbiased coverage of the Last War,
 combined with a distribution deal with House Orien, the <i>Korranberg Chronicle</i> enjoys a loyal and avid readership throughout central Khorvaire. The <i>Chronicle</i>
 is released three times a week (on Mol, Wir, and Far), and each edition
 features some mixture of news from around Khorvaire, stories of 
adventurers and exciting expeditions, business solicitations, royal 
proclamations, and almanac information.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="313" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Offices.</span></span> <p>The <i>Chronicle</i>'s
 main offices are located in Korranberg. The paper also maintains field 
offices in the Five Nations, the Mror Holds, and Zilargo. Each field

 at the office the ready ability to communicate with the home office (at
 discounted rates).</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="314" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Employees.</span></span> <p>The <i>Chronicle</i>
 sends reporters across Khorvaire. Most of them live in Korranberg or 
near one of the field offices, but correspondents might be stationed in 
more remote regions for long periods of time, and the paper frequently 
publishes stories written by freelancers from across the world. Your 
adventuring party most likely falls into that last category, at least at
 the start of your career.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>A
 large staff of editors—mostly but not exclusively comprised of Zil 
gnomes—works out of the newspaper's various offices. They are organized 
into an extensive hierarchy from senior to junior editors. The top tier 
of senior editors is responsible for broad categories of stories, such 
as crime or international affairs. Lower tiers take on increasingly 
specific subsets of that category, down to the junior editor responsible
 for the crime beat in Sharn's Lower Dura district.</p><p>Even the most senior editors, though, are responsible to the top tier of the <i>Chronicle</i>'s management, including its publisher and its secretive board of owners.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="315" data-title-relative-index="8"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Allies.</span></span> <p>The <i>Korranberg Chronicle</i>
 is widely known and respected as a source of balanced news coverage. As
 such, it has friends in many places, including some in positions of 
power. Some of the <i>Chronicle</i>'s closest allies come from the following groups:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>House Orien</b>. House Orien distributes the <i>Chronicle</i> along its mail and lightning rail runs across Khorvaire, helping the newspaper reach a huge audience. Employees of the <i>Chronicle</i> can travel on lightning rail coaches at a discounted rate of 15 cp/mile (instead of the usual 2 sp/mile).</p><p><b>House Sivis</b>.
 The newspaper also cooperates closely with House Sivis to facilitate 
communication between the main office and the field offices, as well as 
between reporters and their editors. The house bills the <i>Chronicle</i> directly for communications using <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#speaking%20stone_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="speaking%20stone_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">speaking stones</a> or <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#sending_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="sending_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">sending</a> spells directed to the newspaper's main office.</p><p><b>Zilargo</b>. The gnome nation of Zilargo is generally friendly to the newspaper. The senior editors, publisher, and owners of the <i>Chronicle</i>
 are influential people in the city of Korranberg and Zilargo as a 
whole. In extreme circumstances Zilargo officials might be persuaded to 
advocate for the newspaper's employees.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="316" data-title-relative-index="8"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>The <i>Korranberg Chronicle</i>
 is dedicated to learning and reporting the truth, and such an attitude 
is always certain to arouse the ire of those who would rather keep their
 secrets hidden. The following represents just a fraction of the enemies
 the newspaper has made over the years:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>The Boromar Clan</b>.
 The dominant crime syndicate in Sharn is still stinging from an exposé 
published ten years ago that resulted in the arrest of many of the 
clan's leaders and gave other gangs a foothold in the city. Members of 
the Boromar Clan go to great lengths—even murder—to sabotage <i>Chronicle</i> reporters who pry into their secrets.</p><p><b>Karrnath</b>.
 King Kaius nurses a grudge against the newspaper stemming from its 
coverage of the peace process at the end of the war, blaming them for 
several setbacks along the way to the eventual signing of the Treaty of 
Thronehold. <i>Chronicle</i> reporters operating in Karrnath often face harassment and find bureaucracy impeding their every effort.</p><p><b>House Thuranni</b>. The snoops and spies of the <i>Chronicle</i> have pried one time too many into House Thuranni's private affairs. No member or agent of the house will cooperate with <i>Chronicle</i> reporters under any circumstances.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 refuse to repay them.</p><p><b>Equipment</b>. Your group can request

With permission, you can use this equipment for your private purposes,

issued identification papers from the nation where the newspaper is

 The Chronicle's publisher, a wily Zil gnome named Cassia Lorridan 
Claddik, is the most public face of its leadership, and her connection 
to Korranberg's ruling Council of Nine is well known. But she is not the
 ultimate authority determining what gets printed and what does not. No,
 that honor goes to the shadowy board of the <i>Chronicle</i>'s owners.</p><p><i>Voice</i>
 reporters have uncovered the names and positions of several members of 
this board, and the results are nothing less than shocking. The 
Trust—the shadowy secret police who maintain order in Zilargo—is well 
represented on this board, raising questions about the extent to which 
the <i>Chronicle</i> is a propaganda engine for Zilargo. Worse still, 
several of the wealthiest and most influential members of the board are 
associated with the Aurum, a shadowy cabal whose primary interest seems 
to be increasing its members' wealth and influence. Whose interest, 
then, does the <i>Chronicle</i> serve?</p><p>All the more reason, loyal readers, to rely on the <i>Voice of Breland</i> for unbiased news you can use.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Civilian</b>.
 Some groups include members whose skills are great for reporting but 
less useful on adventures. This could be the designated writer, a 
political cartoonist, or a chronicler who records the party's 
adventures. This might be a challenging role for a player character to 
fill, but an NPC could provide services to the party, making them worth 
keeping around.</p><p><b>Face</b>. Typically gifted with a high Charisma score and skilled in a combination of <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="insight_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Insight</span>,
 the Face takes the lead in conducting interviews or talking the group's
 way past obstacles. A character with access to enchantment magic (such 
as a bard or sorcerer) can supplement natural Charisma with magical 
persuasion. A character with the charlatan background, proficiency in <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>, or proficiency with a Disguise kit might also fill this role.</p><p><b>Muscle</b>.
 Sometimes sources need a bit of physical cajoling to share their 
stories. The Muscle has a knack for getting people to talk. 
Alternatively, when those in power lock away the truth, the Muscle 
physically wrestles it free. Any character who's proficient with armor 
and martial weapons (such as a fighter) makes a fine choice for this 
role. Characters in this role are often former soldiers or more-or-less 
reformed criminals.</p><p><b>Networker</b>. The Networker knows exactly 
who can get the party what they need. This character makes extensive use
 of contacts and friends to facilitate the party's work. A character

 In times of need, your group can appeal to the priests of your faith 
for magical aid. A cleric or druid of your faith who is of sufficiently 
high level will cast any spell of up to 5th level on your group's

components needed for the spell, so long as you can demonstrate your 
need and are in good standing with the church.</p><p><b>Equipment</b>.

 Templars of the Silver Flame are supposed to represent the Church and 
the nation in pursuit of the highest ideals of the faith, as they 
crusade against the forces of evil across Khorvaire. But are they 
fulfilling that high calling? Or are they just as mired in politics as 
the Brelish bureaucracy?</p><p>High Cardinal Baerdren ir'Davik, who also
 holds the rank of grand master of the templars, appears to be an 
exemplary templar, utterly dedicated to the mission of the order. Yet it
 is widely known that he chafes at the political and bureaucratic 
responsibilities that his position on the Council of Cardinals demands 
of him. This reporter has learned that Sir Baerdren would readily 
surrender his position, were it not for his distrust of his seneschal, 
Ofejjaia of Korth.</p><p>Lady Ofejjaia, it seems, has other issues on 
her personal agenda besides advancing the cause of the knights templar, 
and one wonders if those issues are tied to her Karrnathi origin. Though
 her wisdom and sound judgment are not in dispute, it seems that Sir 
Baerdren fears that she would drive the order into obsolescence or even 
banishment if she were in charge.</p><p>Does Lady Ofejjaia hold her 
lofty position because of her loyalty, her piety, and her 
qualifications? Or is she there simply so that Sir Baerdren can keep his
 eye on her and ensure that she doesn't sabotage the templars from 
within?</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Fixer</b>. The

often a cleric or druid, but could also be an NPC with no real 
adventuring skills, who needs the group's protection.</p><p><b>Scholar</b>. The Scholar brings academic knowledge to bear in the religious order's work, often in the form of proficiency in <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="history_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">History</span> and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="religion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Religion</span>.
 This character might be an expert on ancient ruins or know all the 
weaknesses of the demons they are hunting. Characters with access to 
divination magic (including clerics with the Knowledge domains as well 
as wizards) might excel at this role. Many Scholars come from the sage 
background. Unlike the Prophet and Zealot, the Scholar isn't necessarily
 devout, just knowledgeable.</p><p><b>Teacher</b>. Those in this role 
spread the teachings of the faith. This isn't usually an effort to win 
converts—though it can be, especially in the case of the Church of the 
Silver Flame—but rather the task of encouraging people to live according
 to the highest ideals of faith. Proficiency in skills such as <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span> (or sometimes <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span>) and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="religion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Religion</span>
 can be useful for this character. Many clerics fill this role, but 
devout bards can also be effective Teachers. Some Teachers bring skills 
from the entertainer background into the service of their faith.</p><p><b>Zealot</b>.
 Dedicated to smiting the foes of the faith, the Zealot focuses on 
combat above all. Clerics, druids, and paladins make iconic Zealots, but
 any character can play this role; there are barbarians whose fury is 
fueled by their devotion, and rangers sworn to track down the enemies of
 the faith. The soldier and folk hero backgrounds are well suited to 
such champions of the faith.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="339" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Serving the Order</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p97</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>What

 One of many liturgical councils that serve a mostly administrative role
 for the priests of the Sovereign Host, the Devout manage a large

 institution of higher education sponsors your group. You might be 
researchers, bodyguards for scholars, or glorified treasure hunters 
searching for ancient artifacts. The university might regularly employ 
you or you might have a contact at the university who pays you any time 
you bring back something useful from your adventures. You could be a 
team of academics, or you could be employed to provide some (physical 
and magical) muscle that the university otherwise lacks.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="347" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Morgrave University</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p98</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>At
 the heart of Sharn's Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the 
one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen'drik,
 thanks in large part to Sharn's proximity to the secret continent. Its 
collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen'drik and 
the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the 
shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, to be "a beacon 
of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city."</p><p>On the 
other hand, the university's reputation is tainted by allegations of 
smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics 
recovered from Xen'drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the 
university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the 
hands of the Aurum. It's an open secret that some scholars, professors, 
and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. 
All these allegations, too, have ties to the university's founding: Lord
 Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani 
artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true 
purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such
 questionable means.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="348" data-title-relative-index="10"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Allies.</span></span> <p>The
 academic world is relatively small, and people at any one university 
tend to have connections at others. You might parlay such relationships 
into assistance from academies and institutions, such as the following 
organizations:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>Flamewind</b>.
 The sphinx Flamewind (described in the "Immortal Being" section) isn't 
officially affiliated with the university, but she lives there and 
spends much of her time in its libraries and museums. As a scholar of 
the Draconic Prophecy, Flamewind often poses strange questions and sends
 adventurers on obscure missions.</p><p><b>Library of Korranberg</b>. 
The Library of Korranberg boasts the greatest collection of learning in 
Khorvaire. Its prestige means that people associated with it often look 
down on their colleagues at Morgrave University, but they still 
celebrate the two institutions' common purpose of pursuing knowledge. If
 Morgrave's own libraries are insufficient for the task at hand, your 
group can probably find help in Korranberg.</p><p><b>The Twelve</b>. For
 many scholars of magical studies, the idea of pursuing their research 
under the auspices of the Twelve is a cherished dream. Some faculty 
members at Morgrave have had the opportunity to do just that, and many 
others have nurtured connections to the Twelve in an attempt to secure 
that honor. Those connections can give your group access to powerful 
magic and the other resources of the Twelve.</p><p><b>Wayfinder Foundation</b>.
 Morgrave maintains extensive connections with the Wayfinder 
Foundation—an exclusive guild for adventurers, which funds expeditions 
to distant locales. Should your group needs a grant or resources from 
the Wayfinders, a letter of recommendation from someone at Morgrave 
carries some weight.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="349" data-title-relative-index="10"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Enemies.</span></span> <p>Morgrave
 University has few true enemies but many rivals. Despite the friendly 
ties among academic institutions, Morgrave occupies the low end of the 
prestige scale among academic bodies, so its faculty tends to look for 
opportunities to steal glory from its academic peers. Beyond rivalries 
with allied organizations, Morgrave openly competes with the following 
group:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p><b>University of Wynarn</b>.
 Foremost among Morgrave's rivals is Aundair's University of Wynarn, 
whose administrators have been known to refer to Morgrave as an 
"institute of learning, relic hunting, and grave robbing." The 
University of Wynarn is ancient—the first university established in the 
Five Nations—and more prestigious than Morgrave. It sponsors many of the
 same kind of expeditions and can boast many great discoveries, yet, 
somehow, Morgrave is more famous, and that stings many among the 
university's staff.</p></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="350" data-title-relative-index="9"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Patron Benefits</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p99</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>With a university as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:</p><p><b>Compensation</b>.
 The university pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of 
your employment influences how you are paid. On average, the university 
pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a 
modest lifestyle. Or you might be paid a bounty for each ancient 
artifact you bring back from your adventures and give to the university.</p><p><b>Documentation</b>.
 Each member of your group has identification papers that include your 
affiliation with the university, which carries some clout in academic 
circles. The university also secures documentation, letters of 
introduction, and traveling papers for you if your work requires them. 
Finally, if your adventures take you to Xen'drik, the university secures
 the necessary letters of marque issued by the king of Breland, which 
grant you permission to explore the ruins there.</p><p><b>Research</b>. 
Research might be part of your group's job, but your patron has abundant
 resources to facilitate it. You can call in a favor to delegate the 
work of researching lore (a downtime activity described in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a> or <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XGE">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a>)
 to a colleague, contact, or research assistant. You're responsible for 
covering all expenses occurred as part of this research, and the DM 
determines the success, failure, or other possible results.</p><p><b>Resources</b>.
 Most universities have extensive libraries and museums, which you have 
access to. You can call in a favor to gain access to resources that are 
generally not on exhibit—dangerous relics or possibly magic items, 
spellbooks, and the like. Additionally, the faculty of your university 
might make it possible for you to consult with experts in various 
fields—so long as you can coax them away from their work.</p><p><b>Training</b>.
 Because you're associated with the university, you receive a discount 
on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a 
downtime activity (as described in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a> or <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XGE">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a>),
 you pay only one-half the normal cost, assuming that what you are 
studying is something the university teaches. Training in languages, 
musical instruments, and other tools might also be available, at the 
DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="arcana_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Arcana</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="history_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">History</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="nature_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Nature</span>, or <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="religion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Religion</span> skills by this method, as if you were learning a language.

 group sponsored by a university might look very much like any other 
adventuring party, with a range of diverse skills and capabilities. The 
only significant distinction lies between characters who are scholars 
and those who are more traditional adventurers. Consider some or all of 
these roles for characters in your party:</p><p><b>Field Researcher</b>.
 The academic in your group might also be a character with plenty of 
training and experience in the dangerous life of an adventurer. 
Sometimes called tomb raiders or grave robbers, such characters know 
that groundbreaking work requires firsthand experience with the 
creatures, cultures, forces, and histories being investigated, and the 
best way to get that is in the field. This role is similar to the 
Scholar, but the Field Researcher is armed with combat-oriented spells 
that supplement the knowledge-focused capabilities of the Scholar, 
preparing them to face those who guard the world's greatest secrets.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="352">

			</div></div><p></p><p><b>Financier</b>. Whether they're hunting for 
grants or seeking donations from wealthy philanthropists, the Financier 
seeks the funds to pay for academic expeditions. Such characters might 
know their ways around ballrooms, boardrooms, and seedy taverns, willing
 to do whats necessary to get what they need. Those in this role often 
exude Charisma and might be adept with the <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="deception_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Deception</span>, <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span>, and <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span> skills. Bards and rogues make natural academic Financiers, as do those with the charlatan and noble backgrounds.</p><p><b>Research Assistant</b>.
 Whether their seeking to graduate, get published, or make their 
academic mark, the Research Assistant's fate is likely tied up in the 
success of another scholar or a specific project. Alternatively, the 
Research Assistant might just be along for the ride, helping a professor
 merely to pass a course. Regardless, such characters might come from 
any class or background and could have skills gathered from experiences 
far outside the academic sphere. While there are certainly legitimate 
Research Assistants who honestly pursue their studies, this role might 
suit characters without academic interests.</p><p><b>Scholar</b>. Likely
 possessing a high Intelligence score and a focus on learning and 
research, the Scholar in your party might represent the academic 
emphasis of the university. This character is often a noncombatant, a 
professor or student the rest of the party protects. Alternatively, they
 might live a dual life, shedding their academic persona as soon as 
they're off campus grounds. The Scholar might also be a nonplayer 
character, or the role could be filled by a player character whose 
spells and training don't include combat. A wizard whose spellbook is 
filled with utility-focused spells makes a fine Scholar, as might some 
clerics and monks. In any case, the sage background is an obvious choice
 for the Scholar, with acolyte and hermit also providing fine 
alternatives.

 response to last week's exclusive report detailing a scheme to remove 
precious antiquities from storage at Morgrave University and sell them 
on the black market, Master Larrian ir'Morgrave has issued a statement 
full of the usual platitudes and empty promises we have grown accustomed
 to hearing from the Office of the University Master. In it, ir'Morgrave
 vows to put an end to the criminal activities occurring within the 
university and bolster the school's academic reputation. As regular 
readers of this paper know, he makes such promises frequently, but we 
have yet to see him take any substantive action to back up his promises.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>Numerous
 universities exist across Khorvaire. Morgrave University is the one 
most often connected to adventurous exploits, but the following 
institutes number among Khorvaire's other prominent academic bodies:</p><p><b>Arcanix</b>.
 Housed in elegant towers that float above southern Aundair, Arcanix is a
 place of arcane learning, where the next generation of spellcasters 
studies the intricacies of magic. The mentors at Arcanix comprise the 
Arcane Congress, a council of spellcasters who explore the limits of the
 arcane arts under a mandate instituted by King Galifar I.</p><p><b>Rekkenmark</b>.
 The Military Academy of Rekkenmark has trained Galifar officers for 
hundreds of years and continues to excel as the premier combat training 
facility in all of Khorvaire. Nobles from every nation used to send 
their children to Rekkenmark for at least part of their education, but 
the Last War put an end to that practice. Now that the war is over, the 
academy hopes to welcome students from other nations once again, but so 
far only a handful of students from outside Galifar have come to 
Rekkenmark.</p><p><b>Library of Korranberg</b>. Zilargo's Library of 
Korranberg is the greatest repository of general knowledge in Khorvaire.
 More than just a library, it hosts eight attached colleges dedicated to
 different fields of study, drawing gentry from across Khorvaire who 
come to study there. In addition to serving as a resource for scholars 
and explorers, the library often funds expeditions to study ancient 
cultures or unexplored lands.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="361" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chapter 2: Khorvaire Gazetteer</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p103</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p class="rd__quote-line ">“<i>Just

 I look at the map of Khorvaire with a touch of despair. Galifar lies 
shattered, the Five Nations irreparably divided. So many new realms 
claim sovereignty—kingdoms of elves and goblins, and what of this nation

 further? Should I dwell on such things when the Mourning might simply 
consume us all? Gods, how I fear the future.</i>”</p><p><span class="rd__quote-by">— Lyrian Das, Morgrave historian</span></p><p>Most

 Although humans make up the majority of the population in the nations 
of Khorvaire, the continent is home to a wide range of peoples and 
cultures. Once largely unified under the Kingdom of Galifar, today 
Khorvaire is split into many nations—some old, others newly born from 
the crucible of war. This chapter provides an overview of Khorvaire, a 
glimpse of the world that lies beyond it, and the predominant faiths of 
Eberron.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="362">

Khorvaire, see the introduction of this book.</p><p>An excellent system 
of roads connects the central nations of Khorvaire, and travelers can 
always make their way by horse or coach. Major cities are linked by the 
lightning rail of House Orien, which allows one to avoid the perils—and 
tedium—of the roads. If speed is an issue, one can book passage on a

 the war, the Arcane Congress served all Galifar. The most promising 
students from across Khorvaire came to study at Arcanix, and students 
from Khorvaire, Cyre, and Aundair worked together to win honor in the 
Trials of the Ninefold Path. Known to students simply as the Nine, this 
contest pits students of the eight traditions against one another in a 
series of arcane challenges, along with a ninth bracket for those who 
have yet to select a tradition. Teamwork, independence, memorization, 
innovation—the Nine challenges competitors on many levels, and the 
finest wizards of Galifar were invariably champions of the Nine.</p><p>Thanks
 to the Treaty of Thronehold, students of all nations once again study 
side by side in the towers of Arcanix. But no treaty or ritual can 
easily dispel the tensions of a century of war. Over the last year we've
 reported on a number of hate crimes in the towers fueled by nationalist
 passions. Optimistic teachers hope that the Nine will showcase the 
diversity that has evolved over the course of the past 
century—highlighting Karrnathi advances in necromancy and evocation, 
Cyran illusions, and more. But privately, professors fear that the 
competitive aspect of the Nine will inflame nationalist tension. Some 
even believe that the lives of foreign students could be endangered 
should they defeat Aundairian champions.</p><p>Only time will tell if the Nine can bring us together as it once did, or if it will drive us further apart.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="373" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Passage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p106</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Located

Thaliost, but the city has become a haven for Aundairians who revere the
 Silver Flame.</p><p>The Eldeen Reaches seceded from Aundair halfway 
through the Last War. The western farmers rebelled over high taxes and 
neglect, allying with the druids of the Towering Wood. Aundair was 
forced to accept the sovereignty of the Reaches under the terms of the 
Treaty of Thronehold, but many Aundairians view it as a renegade nation.</p><p>Extensive
 use of magic has repaired most of the damage to the cities of Aundair, 
but the countryside remains scarred by the war, especially along the 
border with Thrane. The Crying Fields are a region of farmlands 
permanently scarred by magic and haunted by restless spirits. 
Aundairians claim their nation is stronger than ever, but some worry 
about the long-term impact of the loss of the Eldeen farmlands and the 
Crying Fields.</p><p>Now, Aundairians debate over differing views of 
their nation's future. Some believe the first focus should be reuniting 
Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force. 
Others consider Thaliost to be the pressing issue. And still others 
support Queen Aurala's claim to the throne of Galifar. When creating an 
Aundairian, consider whether you have ties to any of the affected 
regions and if this influences your opinion of Thranes or druids.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="376" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Breland</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p107</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Wroat</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Espionage, industry, metalwork, organized crime, subterfuge</p><p>In

 Many Brelish have a loose relationship with the law. Even if you're a 
hero, you might have questionable connections or friends in low places. 
Backgrounds such as criminal, spy, or charlatan can reflect this 
tendency, regardless of your class. You could also be a folk hero who 
challenges the laws to protect the innocent, or an entertainer who plays
 in every dive in Sharn.</p><p><b>Innovative and Independent</b>. Find 
your own path in the world; don't simply follow established traditions. 
As a cleric, you might challenge your church and follow your own divine 
revelations. As a wizard, you could search for new techniques or attempt
 to unravel forgotten secrets.</p><p><b>Practical</b>. Whether it's 
about fashion, food, or conversation, the Brelish tend to be pragmatic. 
Why spend a fortune on a fancy meal when a simple one will do? You use 
whatever tool gets the job done, and you don't see a need for

 untouched by a century of war, the Winter Palace suffered an attack 
from an unexpected quarter: the people of Breland. The so-called Swords 
of Liberty have taken credit for a daring raid that left the east wing 
of the palace in flames. No members of the Brelish royal family were in 
attendance during the attack.</p><p>The Swords of Liberty call for the 
violent overthrow of the Wynarn monarchy, demanding that all power be 
invested in the Brelish parliament. Their manifesto draws on the 
speeches of Lord Ruken ir'Clarn, but Lord Ruken has condemned their 
action. "No victory is possible when Brelish fight Brelish," he said in 
Wroat. "But I hope King Boranel can see that the time for change is upon
 us and help us navigate a peaceful transition of power before any more 
innocents are hurt."</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>For 
Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle of enemies and 
alliances. Breland fought Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, and Thrane at various
 points of the war, as well as clashing with Darguun and Droaam. These 
conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of the world, a 
sense that no one can be fully trusted and that people need to look out 
for themselves. As a Brelish character, you could have an axe to grind 
against any of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong 
belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that motivated the 
Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees than any other nation.</p><p>The 
major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both 
Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the
 overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase
 in crime. The southern cities—including Wroat and Sharn—suffered 
relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. 
The city of Vathirond is still repairing the damage from Thrane attacks,
 and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been 
abandoned.</p><p>Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a 
positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it 
ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland 
would have triumphed.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="389" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cyre (The Mournland)</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p109</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Metrol (destroyed)</p><p><b>Previous Hallmarks</b>: Art, artifice, jewelry, music, oratory, philosophy</p><p><b>Current Hallmarks</b>: Destruction, ruins</p><p>Destroyed at the end of the Last War, Cyre now exists only in the hearts of the refugees scattered across Khorvaire.</p><p>Before

diversity and versatility, both in talents and thought. Cyre couldn't 
match Karrnath in martial discipline or Aundair in the arcane arts, but 
the flexibility of its forces reflected the nation's ideals.</p><p>Although
 the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of Cyre, the Silver Flame had
 a significant following. Many survivors question their faith in the

 nation won the Last War, but Cyre unquestionably lost it. Other nations
 are recovering from the conflict, but Cyre is gone. The lands not 
destroyed in the Mourning were lost decades earlier to Darguun and 
Valenar. Cyrans who survived the war must now carve out a new destiny in
 the lands of their enemies or in foreign nations beyond what was once 
the Kingdom of Galifar.</p><p>In creating a Cyran character, first 
determine how you survived the Mourning. Were you outside Cyre when it 
occurred, or did you somehow escape the destruction? Where did you take 
shelter? Breland has taken in refugees and created refugee camps. Thrane
 also accepted refugees but has worked to disperse and integrate them 
into the general population. Are you grateful or bitter? Do you have 
family or friends in refugee camps, or are you a lone survivor? Other 
Cyrans sought opportunities on the frontiers, settling in the jungles of
 Q'barra or seeking a new life in the distant land of Xen'drik.</p><p>Many
 Cyran survivors are soldiers, veterans stationed on the front lines 
when the Mourning occurred. If multiple members of your party are 
Cyrans, you might have served together during the Last War. Because 
Cyrans are so widely dispersed, you can encounter former comrades or 
friends anywhere in Khorvaire.</p><p>Since Cyrans lost their lands, the 
distinctions between peasant and aristocrat have become moot. Even with a
 criminal background, you might have been a viscount in Cyre; your 
background reflects your current standing and the resources you can call
 upon in the present.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="397" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Darguun</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p110</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Rhukaan Draal</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Dungeons, goblinoid mercenaries, ruins</p><p>Goblins
 and their kin have always been part of Khorvaire. Their ancient empire 
spread across the lands now held by other nations, and goblin 
foundations still stand underneath many human cities. This empire 
collapsed into savagery, and when humans arrived from Sarlona, they 
drove the goblins from their ancestral lands. Thus, goblins have long 
been a disenfranchised people, living in the shadows of newer nations or
 in wild lands shunned by humans.</p><p>The land now called Darguun was 
once part of Cyre. The hobgoblin clans known as the Ghaal'dar were based
 in the Seawall Mountains, but during the war, the demand for 
mercenaries drew an ever-increasing number of goblins out of the 
mountains to fight for Cyre and Breland. Late in the war, a brilliant 
hobgoblin named Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor recognized that the goblins had
 become the dominant military power in the region. Uniting the Ghaal'dar
 under his banner, Haruuc seized the territory he was supposed to 
protect. The Five Nations were unprepared, and Breland quickly 
negotiated an alliance with Haruuc to secure the border. Cyre fought the
 goblins until the Day of Mourning, but the majority of delegates 
involved in forging the Treaty of Thronehold chose to recognize the new 
nation of Darguun to ensure peace.</p><p>Darguun is a young and volatile
 nation, ruled by Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. Haruuc remains a brilliant 
strategist and tactician, but many wonder whether he can maintain the 
web of alliances that hold the Ghaal'dar together, and whether he and 
his people will be content to abide by the terms of the treaty. Other 
goblins still hidden in the mountains—the enigmatic Heirs of Dhakaan 
(see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,9,goblinoids%20(heirs%20of%20dhakaan),0">chapter 4</a>)—could pose a threat both to the goblins and the rest of Khorvaire.</p><p>Traditionally,
 the Ghaal'dar worshiped a form of the Dark Six. House Deneith 
introduced the Sovereign Host to the region, and some goblins have 
embraced this faith, especially the gods Dol Dorn, Dol Arrah, and 
Balinor.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="398" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Interesting Things About Darguun</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p111</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">House

 is a frontier nation. Although recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, 
it doesn't abide by the common laws of the treaty nations. Law 
enforcement is unpredictable, and acts considered criminal in other

 hobgoblins; these clans are especially dangerous and violent.</li><li class="rd__li ">Lhesh
 Haruuc united the Ghaal'dar clans and seized control of Darguun nearly 
three decades ago. If you are a non-goblin from this land, you may have

 is a logical point of origin for goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear 
characters. When creating a Ghaal'dar character from Darguun, consider 
the following:</p><p><b>Constant Struggle</b>. Among the Ghaal'dar, you 
must constantly prove your strength and skill to gain and hold the 
respect of your kin. Ghaal'dar rarely kill in a casual battle; you might
 fight to prove a point but kill only when you must.</p><p><b>Loyal to Your Clan.</b>
 Challenge your peers as you like in times of peace, but when blades 
unsheathe for war, you stand by your clan—or those allies you have 
bonded with—until death. This loyalty doesn't extend to warriors of 
other Ghaal'dar clans.</p><p><b>Muut and Atcha</b>. Your ancestors once 
forged an empire even greater than Galifar. Perhaps you believe that 
your people can reclaim this lost glory. The Dhakaani were renowned for 
their martial skill and their discipline. <i>Muut</i> roughly translates
 to "duty"—your duty to your empire, your clan, and your commander. Muut
 is expected; if you have no muut, you have no place in battle. <i>Atcha</i> corresponds to "honor," especially your personal honor gained by virtuous deeds that transcend the expectations of muut.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="400" data-title-relative-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cities and Sites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p111</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Thirty

 was born in the Last War, and the scars of its birth are still raw. 
Most of the Cyran population fled the goblin uprising, and those who 
remained were killed or enslaved. As a result, many burnt-out farms and 
abandoned villages have stood empty for decades. The broken paths of the
 lightning rail make travel into the interior difficult, and only the 
largest cities offer the basic services common elsewhere in the treaty 
nations.</p><p>Any significant settlement is likely the domain of a 
single Ghaal'dar clan. While these clans give their fealty to Lhesh 
Haruuc, every clan lord holds absolute power in their town. Some clans 
are friendly to outsiders and welcome commerce. Others despise 
non-goblins. Lhesh Haruuc has abolished slavery in Rhukaan Draal, but 
some of clan lords continue this practice.</p><p>Overall, Darguun is a 
nation that is still finding its identity—a kingdom that seeks to be 
more than a seized territory. The goblins carry the legacy of a mighty 
empire and stand in the shadow of the nations around them. Haruuc wants 
to draw out the best in his people, to harness their strengths and 
achieve their potential. The rest of Khorvaire waits to see if the 
Ghaal'dar have the will to remain a nation, and if Darguun can survive 
when Haruuc passes away.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="408" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Demon Wastes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p112</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: None</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Fiends, pestilence</p><p>Rivers

linger in this place even as new ones crawl up from the depths of 
Khyber. A handful of primordial ruins sustained by dark magic dot the 
bleak landscape—ruins that may still be home to fiends and their 
treasures.</p><p>The Stone Cage, Shadowcrags, and Icehorn Mountains 
separate the Demon Wastes from the Eldeen Reaches. A series of canyons 
known as the Labyrinth further separate the Demon Wastes from the rest 
of Khorvaire. Due to ancient warding magic, any creature that wishes to 
leave must do so through the Labyrinth. These passes are guarded by the 
Ghaash'kala, tribes of orcs sworn to contain the evils of the Wastes. 
Beyond the Labyrinth, the mortal inhabitants of the Demon Wastes include
 a brutal people known as the Carrion Tribes. Each tribe is devoted to 
an archfiend, and they engage in endless battles against the Ghaash'kala

 That thought echoed through my mind as the wagon carried us toward the 
Great Crag. The diplomats around me intended to speak with the Daughters
 of Sora Kell. All I could think about was the stories my grandmother 
used to tell me. <i>Sora Maenya can crush a giant with her bare hands. 
She can eat the whole creature and still be hungry. If you're bad, 
she'll come in the night and carry you away. She'll make a lantern of 
your skull and torment you until the end of time.</i> And she's the <i>least</i> frightening member of the Daughters of Sora Kell!</p><p>When
 I could set aside my sheer terror, I was learning a great deal about 
this strange nation. The Daughters invested power in warlords, each of 
whom rules a territory in their name. It's sort of like Karrnath, except
 each of the warlords of Droaam is a horrifying monster. We were 
traveling through the territory of the Prince of Bones, an ancient troll
 said to be too evil to die. We'd already passed through the domain of 
Queen Sheska the medusa, where even the trees are turning to stone. 
Harpies. Gargoyles. There's even a king of the kobolds. Our caravan was 
being protected by gnolls. Not protected <i>from</i> gnolls, protected <i>by</i> gnolls. I thought things couldn't get any stranger. I couldn't have been more wrong....</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p><b>Capital</b>: The Great Crag</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Byeshk ore, monstrous mercenaries</p><p>Droaam
 is a nation of monsters ruled by the Daughters of Sora Kell. Each of 
these three hags is a legend in her own right, the subjects of tales 
used to frighten children. Eleven years ago, they seized the lands west 
of the Graywall Mountains and founded the nation of Droaam.</p><p>Although
 Breland laid claim to these barren lands, Galifar had never tamed this 
wild region. Gnolls, orcs, and goblins commonly sought haven here, as 
well as ogres, trolls, harpies, minotaurs, medusas, tieflings, 
changelings, lycanthropes, and other races unwelcome in civilized lands.
 In the past, these creatures fought one another more often than they 
raided human settlements. Under the leadership of the Daughters of Sora 
Kell, they have new purpose. The Daughters use an army of ogres and war 
trolls to maintain order.</p><p>To date, the other nations of Khorvaire 
have refused to recognize Droaam, and the region was not acknowledged in
 the Treaty of Thronehold. Most people believe that the monstrous nation
 can't last—that even the Daughters can't hold the disparate alliance 
together—but Droaam is currently thriving and stronger than ever.</p><p>Droaam
 works closely with House Tharashk, selling the services of monstrous 
soldiers and laborers and byeshk ore, a form of metal with magical 
properties. Beyond that, it's a still-expanding frontier nation. The 
cities of Graywall and Great Crag grow larger and more organized every 
day, and the rest of Khorvaire is uneasy with the potential power of a

 with undead. The current king, Kaius ir'Wynarn III, broke ties with the
 Blood of Vol and has stopped creating new undead, but Karrnath still 
has a significant number of skeletons and zombies in service. Many 
Karrns still believe in the Blood of Vol and approve of the use of

 ir'Wynarn III emerged from the shadows like a villain in one of 
Kessler's plays. His guardians kept him hidden during his youth while 
his aunt Moranna served as the regent of Karrnath. So it was a surprise 
to many when he burst forth to claim his crown and his power, all the 
more so because of his uncanny resemblance to Kaius I, the ruler who 
plunged Karrnath into the Last War and instituted the brutal system of 
laws that bears his name.</p><p>Given the circumstances of Kaius III's 
ascension, it's hardly surprising that the new king would face 
challenges from the proud warlords of Karrnath. Some questioned his 
lineage and his ability to command. But the most unusual challenge came 
from the warlord Drago Thul: was Kaius III actually alive? Kaius I had 
elevated the Blood of Vol in Karrnath and instituted the use of undead 
as weapons of war. Drago Thul asserted that Kaius III was actually Kaius
 I, a vampiric monster "seeking to drain the lifeblood of Karrnath 
itself." This was a serious accusation; the undead have no rights under 
the Code of Galifar and cannot inherit titles or lands. Thul's challenge
 spread like wildfire, only to be crushed when Kaius III met the 
warlords under the midday sun and cut his palm to show his freely 
flowing blood.</p><p>This should have been the end of it, but the tale 
of the Vampire King has proven surprisingly resilient. Some say that the
 king developed special enchantments to avoid the effects of sunlight; 
others say that he has relies on changeling impersonators to take his 
place in the daylight. As for Drago Thul, he refused to stand down when 
Kaius III pushed for peace and the Treaty of Thronehold. He fled to the 
city of Stormreach in Xen'drik with a small band of followers, and he 
continues to rally support against "the monster that sits on our 
throne."</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Rekkenmark

School of Evocation or Necromancy as their arcane tradition.</p><p><b>The Dead</b>.
 Undead soldiers have served in Karrnath's armies for decades. How do

 has always been a martial nation, and its people remain vigilant. Early
 in the war, King Kaius I instituted the Code of Kaius, a strict set of 
laws and limits. Karrnath weathered a number of famines during the war, 
and this privation led to an ongoing program of rationing to ensure that
 the nation is prepared for whatever lies ahead. The war is over, but 
the Code of Kaius and the rationing remains in place; the people of 
Karrnath willingly endure ongoing hardship to ensure that their future 
is secure. The populace frowns on excess of any sort, accepts limits on 
luxury items, and approves of swift and harsh punishments for crime.</p><p>King
 Kaius III was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold and 
remains committed to peace. However, many of the nation's warlords 
believe that Karrnath would have won the Last War and that Kaius denied 
the Karrnathi people their rightful destiny. Should these warlords gain 
sufficient support, they could push for a military coup.</p><p>A second 
destabilizing factor is the tension between the followers of the Blood 
of Vol and the Karrnathi traditionalists. The Seekers assert that the 
Blood of Vol saved Karrnath and point to the power of its undead troops.
 The traditionalists claim that the dark magic of the Seekers caused 
famines and plagues, crippling Karrnath and forcing it to rely on the 
undead. The Blood of Vol could back an uprising in Karrnath, or those 
who wish to drive out the Seekers could trigger a civil war.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="447" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lhazaar Principalities</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p119</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Regalport</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Fish, mercenaries, merchants, pirates, ships</p><p>This

alliance. Each island domain has its own values, goals, and feuds with 
other domains. The Lhazaar are the finest sailors in Khorvaire. During 
the Last War, they served all nations as privateers and engaged in 
piracy on the side. When the war ended, they returned to the merchant

their independence. Here, anyone can rise to captain a ship or even 
seize a principality. Leadership is earned, not given. Nevertheless, 
High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn of Regalport seeks to forge the 
principalities into a unified force. He has the finest fleet, and his 
efforts ensured that the principalities gained recognition at 
Thronehold, after which he awarded himself the title of High Prince. So 
far, the other princes have rejected his proposals for a stronger union.</p><p>Some

can switch a tool proficiency for vehicles (water) proficiency. Lhazaar 
are flamboyant people with little concern for the law, so charlatan, 
entertainer, and folk hero are all appropriate backgrounds.</p><p><b>Local Customs</b>.
 Each principality has its own martial traditions, fashions, and slang. 
Think about how your choices reflect your principality and work with 
your DM to develop one that fits your character.</p><p><b>Big Dreams</b>.
 Whatever their circumstances, the people of the principalities always

made an astonishing discovery: the ruins of an ancient dwarven empire, 
vast halls deep within the Ironroot Mountains. Explorers uncovered mines
 still brimming with jewels and precious ores and vaults filled with 
riches and powerful artifacts. The Mror restored these ancient 
fortresses and worked to reclaim the secrets of their ancestors. Seeing 
the untapped potential of the Realm Below and the broken Kingdom of 
Galifar, the clan lords joined together to form the Iron Council and to 
declare the independence and sovereignty of the Mror Holds.</p><p>One 
question remained: What had become of the ancient dwarves? The answer 
soon became apparent. As the Mror delved deeper into the Realm Below, 
they woke an ancient evil: <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#dyrrn_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="dyrrn_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Dyrrn</a>
 the Corruptor, a daelkyr lord of madness. Hordes of aberrations and 
derro rose from the depths to challenge the explorers. For decades, the 
Mror lords have been fighting a battle in the depths, struggling to 
drive the darkness from their ancestral halls. Many dwarves revile 
anything to do with the daelkyr. Others believe that the daelkyr can 
grant the Mror dwarves the power to overcome any enemy. Some clans have 
taken up symbionts and living weapons recovered from the depths, and 
cabals of warlocks draw on the power of the Plane of Xoriat (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,10">chapter 4</a>).</p><p>The
 Mror Holds consist of a loose confederation. Twelve noble clans each 
govern a hold and have a representative on the Iron Council, which 
resolves disputes and issues affecting the entire nation. Each hold 
includes a number of lesser clans, who owe fealty to the noble line. 
Those who occupy land above have the right to claim the halls that lie 
below if they can.</p><p>The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of the
 Mror Holds. Kol Korran is the most beloved of the Sovereigns, but the 
dwarves also revere Boldrei, Dol Dorn, Olladra, and Onatar.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="457" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Interesting Things About the Mror Holds</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p120</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The

called the Jhorash'tar live among the Ironroot Mountains. The 
Jhorash'tar have been slowly crowded into the least hospitable regions

Jhorash'tar into Mror society, but others wish to drive them out once

artifacts and arcane secrets from the Realm Below. Dwarf artificers are 
still working to master the techniques of their ancestors, while 
warlocks strive to harness the powers of the daelkyr. Mror communities 
are shaped by the artifacts they possess or by their interactions with 
the daelkyr. A Mror lord might serve guests from a bottomless cauldron 
of wine, while another studies strangers using a crown of eyes, claiming
 that this living artifact reveals all evil intent.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="458" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mror Characters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p121</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As you develop a Mror character or NPC, consider the following:</p><p><b>Clan Focus</b>.
 The dwarf clan is the heart of Mror culture. Is your clan known for 
mercantile power or martial skill? Are you a noble—even if you're a few 
steps removed from true power? Or are you a guild artisan or soldier? 
Most Mror have embraced modern martial techniques, but a few minor clans
 still cling to barbarian traditions of the past. What caused you to 
leave your hold? Are you serving your clan and honing your skills, or 
have you been exiled from your homeland?</p><p><b>The Realm Below</b>. 
How has the Realm Below affected your family and your character? Do you 
oppose the foul forces that infest your ancestral halls, or do you see 
them as a source of power? You might be a paladin sworn to oppose the 
horrors that dwell in the deep, or you could be a warlock who's forged a
 pact with a Great Old One patron, one of the dark powers in the depths.</p><p><b>Pride in Possessions</b>.
 From the wealthiest clan lord to the humblest miner, the Mror take 
great pride in their possessions. Quality is more important than 
appearance, and you are interested in the history of the items you 
carry. If you find a magic weapon, you want to know the battles it has 
seen and the warriors who have wielded it before you. This is especially
 true of the relics recovered from the Realm Below. Who forged the blade
 you carry? Do you bear a trinket from a forgotten age?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="459" data-title-relative-index="9"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cities and Sites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p121</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="460" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Voice of Karrnath—Mror Holds: Birthplace of abomination!</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p121</span></span><p>It's
 been exactly seventy years since the Iron Council declared the Mror 
Holds' independence from Karrnath. King Kaius II was newly seated on the
 steel throne and lacked the resolve to bring the dwarf lords to heel. 
Now we see the harvest we have sown, and it is horrifying. Without the 
firm hand of Karrnath to keep them on a righteous path, the Mror dwarves
 have embraced foul powers.</p><p>Witness Lord Malus Soldorak, seen in 
Korth this week for trade negotiations. His breastplate was forged from 
chitin and muscle, and it seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat. A 
guard present at the event said that Soldorak's axe moaned when the 
blade came close to him, as if the weapon hungered for human blood.</p><p>This
 is what springs from our mercy and forbearance. Who knows what horrors 
the dwarves are crafting—or breeding—in their mountain halls? We cannot 
stand by and let this vileness continue. For the good of our nation, we 
call on all true Karrns to demand that Regent Moranna unleash our full 
might on the Mror Holds and cleanse this horror!</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>The
 Mror Holds spread across the Ironroot Mountains. Most Mror communities 
are at least partially subterranean, extending down into the mountains. 
The Realm Below is deep beneath the surface, and not every town has a 
passage to it.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="461" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Krona Peak</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p121</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Located

believed that the Jhorash'tar orcs were responsible, but now it seems 
more likely that the Noldrun opened a path to the Realm Below. What 
malevolent powers have claimed the halls of Noldrunhold?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="464" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Realm Below</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p121</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>No
 one knows the extent or depth of the ancient dwarven empire deep 
beneath the Ironroot Mountains. Great wealth and arcane secrets remain 
hidden in these halls, along with endless hordes of aberrations. As a 
Mror adventurer, you could help your family reclaim lands from the Realm
 Below, or you could lead your allies into the deep in search of wealth 
and glory.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="465" data-title-relative-index="8"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aftermath of the Last War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p122</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Mror Holds declared independence during the Last War. Many nations 
depend on the resource of the Holds, and the Treaty of Thronehold 
affirmed its sovereignty.</p><p>To the casual observer, the Mror 
dwarves' star appears to be rising. Their mines seem to offer limitless 
resources. Mror artificers make amazing strides as they study the relics
 of their ancestors. The dwarves are proud of their ancient past and 
optimistic about the future. Most Mror are generous and courageous, 
eager to show off their wealth and accomplishments.</p><p>Those who dig 
deeper realize that this prosperity is built on an unstable foundation. 
The Last War may be over, but the war against the daelkyr has barely 
begun. The clan lords hold their reclaimed halls in the Realm Below, but
 no one knows the full extent of the power of the daelkyr. A renewed 
assault could come at any time, whether it's a force of monsters boiling
 up from below or a creeping madness that infects the weak-willed.</p><p>The
 dwarves are also divided by their attitude toward the aberrations. Some
 of the clans—notably Soldorak—embrace symbionts and other daelkyr 
gifts; some even experiment with flesh-warping techniques and create 
their own monsters. Others—notably Clan Mroranon—avoid contact with the 
aberrations. Such dwarves treasure the relics of their ancestors but 
despise those who use symbionts or form pacts with the darkness.</p><p>Long
 ago, the dwarves engaged in vicious feuds that kept them from uniting 
as a nation. This new divide could reignite those rivalries, leading to a

 is a young nation on the edge of Khorvaire, an untamed frontier filled 
with danger and opportunity. During the golden age of Galifar, few 
humans bothered to cross the Endworld Mountains to explore the vast 
jungle beyond. When the Last War broke out, a fleet of settlers came to 
Q'barra in search of a new home far from the war. As this settlement 
expanded, the settlers discovered massive deposits of Eberron 
dragonshards (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12">chapter 5</a>).
 Over the past decade, a wave of prospectors, wandslingers, refugees, 
and fortune-seekers have descended on Q'barra, along with brigands, 
deserters from the war, and all manner of criminals and opportunists.</p><p>To
 their surprise, Q'barra was already home to a number of ancient 
civilizations humans know nothing about: the lizardfolk of the Cold Sun 
Federation, the dragonborn of Ka'rhashan, and the confederacy of the 
Poison Dusk lizardfolk. Most settlers refer to them collectively as 
"scales." King Sebastes ir'Kesslan of Newthrone has established a treaty
 with the Cold Sun Federation, but communication has been difficult and 
prospectors rarely abide by the terms of the treaty.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="467" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Interesting Things About Q'barra</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p122</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Q'barra

 tempts explorers from the west with the prospects of wealth and new 
lands to conquer—mostly humans but including members of all races found 
in Khorvaire. Settlers, dragonborn, and lizardfolk characters who 
originate here should consider the following:</p><p><b>Settlers</b>. 
Q'barra is an excellent place to explore the traditional archetypes of 
the classic Western. As a paladin, you could be a lone sheriff seeking 
to protect your newly formed mining village. Your cleric could be the 
town preacher. As a sorcerer or bard with a criminal background, you 
could be a dashing wandslinger looking for trouble and gold.</p><p><b>Renegades and Regrets</b>.
 Q'barra promises a land of opportunity and a place where you can leave 
your past behind. Are you a deserter? Were you convicted of a crime you 
didn't commit? Are you fleeing from a broken heart? Q'barra has also 
drawn Cyran refugees and newly freed warforged, both seeking a home in 
the wild east.</p><p><b>Lizardfolk</b>. The lizardfolk's primitive 
culture blends druidic traditions with the beliefs of the Silver Flame. 
You might have been sent to study the softskins—to learn about them and 
potentially serve as an envoy for your people. Alternatively, you could 
be following a spiritual vision.</p><p><b>Dragonborn</b>. The dragonborn
 live amid the remnants of ancient glory. They have a proud martial 
tradition, and a number of dragonborn venture west in search of worthy 
challenges. If you follow this path, you might have served as a 
mercenary in the Last War.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="469" data-title-relative-index="10"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cities and Sites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p123</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Q'barra
 is split into three main regions. New Galifar is the original colony; 
it has a feudal structure and holds to the laws of the Treaty of 
Thronehold. To the north, Hope is a collection of small mining towns. In
 Hope, the law goes only as far as the people willing to enforce it. 
Beyond these human regions lie the unexplored lands of the scales.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="470" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Haka'torvhak</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p123</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Explorers
 tell stories of a city hidden deep in the jungles of Q'barra—a wondrous

demon.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="471" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Newthrone</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p123</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 capital of New Galifar and the seat of King Sebastes, Newthrone is the 
largest city and port in Q'barra. Myriad people from all over Khorvaire 
mingle here in crowded streets. Soldiers pay little heed to the rampant 
crime in these streets, viewing it instead as part of life in the port 
city.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="472" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Wyrmwatch</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p123</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 thriving prospecting town in Hope, Wyrmwatch was established by Cyran 
refugees. Although far smaller than New Cyre in Breland, its people are 
proud of what they have built. The independent community is led by Elder
 Nevillom, a veteran and evangelist of the Silver Flame. Nevillom's 
courage and passionate sermons help sustain the people of Wyrmwatch in 
difficult times.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="473" data-title-relative-index="9"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aftermath of the Last War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p123</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 influx of Cyran refugees promises to reshape Q'barra. Most of the 
settlers are peaceful people searching for a homes and opportunities, 
but some among them chose Q'barra over refugee camps because they 
refused to accept charity from former enemies. These "Mourners" rob and 
kill settlers from the nations that fought against Cyre. Hope also has 
its share of brigands and criminals, bandits who prey on House Tharashk 
convoys and settlers alike.</p><p>The relationship between the settlers 
and the natives is another source of tension. Although King Sebastes 
forged a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, the prospectors of Hope 
regularly violate this treaty. The Poison Dusk lizardfolk are hostile to
 both the settlers and the Cold Sun Federation. Conflicts between 
settlers and scales have escalated over the last four years, and many 
fear that worse is yet to come.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="474" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Shadow Marches</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p123</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Zarash'ak (unofficial)</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Eberron dragonshards, herbs</p><p>When
 most people think of the Shadow Marches, they imagine a fetid backwater
 where illiterate humans mingle with orcs and other foul creatures, 
practicing strange rites by the light of the moons. While flawed, this 
vision isn't entirely inaccurate. The Shadow Marches are a desolate land
 of swamps and moors. The homeland of the orcs, the Marches were scarred
 in the ancient conflict with the daelkyr. The fiends left twisted 
creatures and aberrations in the swamps, and sowed seeds of madness that
 linger to this day. There are indeed moonlit rituals in the Marches: 
some to honor the daelkyr, others to maintain the wards that keep them 
trapped in Khyber.</p><p>Humans came to the Marches long ago, refugees 
fleeing a war in the distant land of Sarlona. Over time the two cultures
 merged, forming the Marches as they exist today.</p><p>The Marches had 
little contact with the Kingdom of Galifar or the east until a few 
hundred years ago, when a House Sivis expedition made two discoveries: 
the region contained valuable dragonshards, and a number of clans had 
manifested the Dragonmark of Finding. This led to the foundation of 
House Tharashk, as these clans joined together to master the economic 
potential of their mark and leverage their mineral wealth.</p><p>The 
Shadow Marches aren't a nation. No one voice speaks for the clans and 
tribes, and most of the tribes have no interest in dealing with 
outsiders. House Tharashk is the largest faction in the region, and 
their city of Zarash'ak is the center for commerce.</p><p>House Tharashk
 is the main point of contact between the Shadow Marches and the outside
 world. Tharashk aside, the region remains a collection of tribes and 
cultists following their ancient traditions in the shadows of the 
swamps.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="475" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Interesting Things About the Shadow Marches</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p124</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The

 in defeat, the daelkyr sowed seeds of madness in the Marches. Followers

 An alliance of Marcher clans formed House Tharashk, but not all those 
who carried the mark chose to join this house. As a half-orc with the 
Mark of Finding, you could be a child of the Marches with a strong tie 
to the house, or you could be a scion of a small tribe of hunters, proud
 of your independence and suspicious of the houses. Your ties to the 
Marches might be distant because you were born to a family that left 
years ago. Do you want to rediscover your ancestral roots?</p><p><b>Madness and Mysticism</b>.
 Most Marchers have a mystical view of the world, beliefs shaped by the 
traditions of the Gatekeepers and the madness of the daelkyr. Marchers 
typically feel that the people of the treaty nations are <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="blinded_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">blinded</a>
 by their civilized ways. You have heard the truth in the voices of 
croaking frogs and seen it in the shadows shifting on the water. Whether
 you're loyal to the Gatekeepers, the Sovereign Host, or the Dragon 
Below, superstitions inform your path.</p><p><b>Clan or Tribe</b>? The 
people of the Shadow Marches are split into two distinct cultures. The 
clans blend the traditions of human and orc, building towns and working 
with steel. If you were raised in one of the clans, the ways of 
civilization aren't that strange to you; you've seen the city of 
Zarash'ak and worked with House Tharashk. By contrast, the Marcher 
tribes maintain traditions that predate humanity. As nomadic 
hunter-gatherers, they don't work metals; they make their tools from 
stone, hide, wood, and bone. If your character is from one of the 
Marcher tribes, you might be the first of your people to leave the 
swamps. Why have you left your people, and how are you adapting to this 
new world?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="477" data-title-relative-index="11"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cities and Sites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p124</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 clans of the Shadow Marches primarily live in small towns and villages,
 their huts raised above the swamps on stilts. The Shadow Marches 
contain many manifest zones tied to Xoriat and Kythri (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,10">chapter 4</a>
 for descriptions of both), the planes of madness and chaos. Time moves 
strangely in places in the deep swamps, which twists mundane beasts and 
plants into strange shapes. Daelkyr ruins linger in these areas, 
remnants of the ancient war against the goblins and orcs that once 
dominated Khorvaire.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="478" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dragonshard Fields</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p124</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 Shadow Marches hold deposits of Eberron dragonshards, the source of

 overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely 
dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by 
ship to the port city of Zarash'ak. Built on stilts and known for its 
cuisine and music, Zarash'ak offers the rare exports of the land without
 the difficulty of navigating the swamps. House Tharashk oversees the 
City of Stilts, but Marcher clans and tribes come here to sell crafts 
and other goods or to celebrate religious rituals.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="481" data-title-relative-index="10"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aftermath of the Last War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p124</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Shadow Marches aren't a nation, and the region wasn't recognized by the
 Treaty of Thronehold. Most Marchers have little interest in the outside
 world. Marcher tribes don't know the names or number of the nations 
beyond the swamps, let alone that they were at war. However, as House 
Tharashk gains power and influence in the world beyond the swamps, it 
has increased its presence in its homeland. The house has expanded 
Zarash'ak dramatically over the last decade and is working on 
transforming other towns into cities. This has caused tension with a 
number of tribes. And House Tharashk's mining operations and its urban 
expansion always run the risk of disrupting Gatekeeper seals and 
unleashing ancient evils bound beneath the Marches.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="482" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Talenta Plains</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p125</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Gatherhold</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Dinosaurs, halflings, livestock</p><p>The

dinosaurs of the plains and use these creatures as mounts, livestock, 
and beasts of burden. A sacred bond exists between a hunter and mount, 
and few people are prepared to face a raging halfling barbarian riding a
 furious clawfoot raptor.</p><p>Talenta religion reveres spirits, both 
departed ancestors and natural spirits. Each tribe has a lath—a 
chieftain who guides the tribe—and shamans who consult the spirits and 
choose the paths of migration.</p><p>In the past, the tribes stood 
alone, but during the Last War, many halflings came together under 
Lathon Halpum to defend their land. Halpum won recognition for the 
Plains as one of the Thronehold nations, though it's still unclear what 
this means beyond increasing passage between the Plains and the outside

 chapter 1 for quirks and other features relevant to halfling characters
 from the Talenta Plains. Also consider the following:</p><p><b>Wild Warriors and Tricksters.</b>
 You were born in the wild, and your wits and your weapons helped you 
survive. Talenta warriors are often barbarians or rangers, relying on 
speed and skill. Outlander is a logical background, but you could easily
 be a folk hero, entertainer, or charlatan. You could even be an urchin 
who was stranded in a great city and adapted to life there.</p><p><b>Surrounded by Spirits</b>.
 Fey, fiends, and the ghosts of ancestors, these are all part of the 
spirit world, and they're all around you. Do you believe that the 
spirits guide your actions? Do you show respect to the spirits of a 
location? Talentan shamans tend to be druids of the Circle of the Moon 
or the Circle of the Shepherd (from <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XGE">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a>),
 often assuming the form of dinosaurs. You could also reflect a strong 
bond to spirits by playing a warlock with an Archfey patron, a cleric 
with the Nature domain, a paladin sworn to the Oath of the Ancients, or a
 barbarian on the Path of the Totem Warrior or Path of the Ancestral 
Guardian (from <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XGE">Xanathar's Guide to Everything</a>).
 Hermit and outlander are natural backgrounds, but you could be an 
acolyte or a sage who consults spirits instead of books. Warriors and 
shamans both wear masks to present a particular face to the spirit 
world.</p><p><b>Dinosaurs</b>. Talenta halflings have a close bond to 
their dinosaur companions. If you don't begin the campaign with a 
dinosaur mount or companion, you might acquire one over the course of 
your adventures. You can also consider whether a fallen dinosaur is part
 of your backstory; perhaps you lost your faithful mount in the Last 
War, but you believe its spirit is still with you.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="485" data-title-relative-index="12"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cities and Sites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p126</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Talenta Plains have been described as an ocean of grasslands. The 
nomadic halflings have little interest in building towns; most shelter 
in the Talenta Plains is temporary. Halflings shun the ruins scattered 
across the Plains, believing them to be haunted by fiends.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="486" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gatherhold</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p126</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>All
 the halfling tribes come to Gatherhold to trade, hold councils, and 
settle disputes. House Ghallanda maintains the town, but Gatherhold 
belongs to the people, not the houses. Other dragonmarked houses offer 
their services here as well. The town is on the shore of Lake Cyre, and 
once people came by boat through Cyre; now the Mourning has cut off that
 passage.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="487" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Wandering Inn</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p126</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>This
 caravan maintained by members of House Ghallanda is a traveling fair,

Thronehold. Now that the war is over, most of the tribes have returned 
to their hunting grounds and ancient traditions. They united to defend 
their way of life, and now they wish to enjoy it.</p><p>But the 
halflings don't yet know if it's possible to return to the previous 
ways. More foreigners visit the Plains than at any time in the past. 
Settlers and merchants cross the Plains as they make their way to 
Q'barra, and they clash with Q'barran bandits. The Valenar elves ride 
through the Plains in search of adventure. Monsters emerge from the 
Mournland. Dragonmarked houses seek to expand their role at Gatherhold 
and to explore the untapped resources of the Plains.</p><p>The halflings
 have no interest in change, but it might be inevitable. Lathon Halpum 
believes that if the tribes can work together, they could become a 
nation of nations, but others aggressively oppose such a path. Holy 
Uldra is a powerful shaman and the leader of her own tribe. She urges 
halfling warriors to join together for a single purpose: to drive all 
outsiders from the Plains and to maintain the ancient traditions. The 
halflings must decide whether the tribes will choose the path of peace 
or return to war.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="489" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Thrane</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p126</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Flamekeep</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Divine magic, fine crafts, fruit, livestock, the Silver Flame, textiles, wool</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="490" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Sharn Inquisitive—I was scorched by the Silver Flame!</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p126</span></span><p>Growing
 up on the streets of the Callestan district in Sharn, I learned not to 
put my faith in anything I couldn't see or hold. I think that's why my 
editor sent me to Flamekeep to cover the Ascension; surely I'd see 
clearly, with eyes untouched by faith. I thought so, too. But then I 
found myself in the Chamber of Tira's Sacrifice, a pillar of silver fire
 marking the spot where one woman gave her life to protect countless 
innocents. I saw people from all nations joined together in song, 
celebrating both that ancient sacrifice and the end of our current war. 
And looking into the innocent eyes of the child priestess, I truly heard
 the words of that song for the first time: a call for all of us to be 
better than we are, to protect those in need, to remember that we are 
all one people in the light of the Silver Flame.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>The
 modern Church of the Silver Flame was founded in Thrane, and most of 
the people of the nation follow this faith. During the Last War, the 
people of Thrane chose to set aside the rule of the monarchy and to 
embrace the leadership of the church. For the last seventy years, Thrane
 has been a theocracy. The head of the state is 11-year-old Jaela Daran,
 the divinely selected Keeper of the Flame. Jaela depends on the Council
 of Cardinals to perform the practical work of running the nation.</p><p>The
 primary purpose of the Silver Flame is to defend the innocent from 
supernatural evil. The church has always had a militant aspect, with 
battalions of templars and peasant militias prepared to face undead, 
lycanthropes, or other monstrous threats. But compassion and charity are
 core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all 
innocents. Even during the Last War, if a fiendish threat arose in a 
Brelish village, Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an 
end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes 
believe the church is destined to reunite Galifar under the Silver 
Flame, and corrupt priests are interested only in power and wealth.</p><p>Not
 all priests are clerics, and the typical templar is a mundane warrior. 
However, due to the deep faith of its people, Thrane produces more 
clerics and paladins than any other nation in Khorvaire.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="491" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Interesting Things About Thrane</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p127</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Faith is part of daily life in Thrane, and divine adepts provide important services.

 town has a militia ready to deal with supernatural threats, and people 
stand together to fight darkness. Champions of the light find support 
and hospitality, but any character who dabbles with dark 
forces—necromancers, warlocks, and the like—finds Thrane a dangerous, 
unwelcoming place.</li><li class="rd__li ">The feudal system of nobility
 remains in place, but ultimate authority rests in the hands of the 
church. Queen Diani ir'Wynarn is the "blood regent," serving as a 
symbolic advisor to the Keeper of the Flame. A small fraction of the 
population would like to see the traditional monarchy restored to power.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="492" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Thrane Characters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p127</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As you develop a Thrane character, consider the following details:</p><p><b>The Impact of Faith.</b>
 If you want to reflect a close bond to the Silver Flame, you could gain
 a few divine spells by taking the Magic Initiate feat. Archery is a 
devotional practice of the Silver Flame, so as a martial Thrane you 
might focus on archery-related combat styles or take the Sharpshooter 
feat. Any Thrane could take the acolyte background to reflect a strong 
connection to the church or the soldier background based on service with
 the templars.</p><p><b>Church or Crown</b>? Do you support the 
theocracy, or would you like to see power restored to the throne? Many 
people of faith believe that miring the church in politics distracts it 
and invites corruption.</p><p><b>Dealing with Darkness</b>. The Shadow 
in the Flame can tempt even the most virtuous soul. How do you react 
when you encounter corruption and greed? Are you a compassionate person 
who seeks to lead people to the light, or a zealot determined to crush 
all darkness?</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="493">

 is a grim reminder of the cost of the war. Once known as the Jewel of

Aundairian followers of the extremist Pure Flame sect; violence often 
breaks out between these two factions.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="498" data-title-relative-index="12"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aftermath of the Last War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p128</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 war is over, but deep rifts remain between Thrane and its neighbors. 
Aundairian war magic created a blasted wasteland between the two 
nations. To the east, the conflict with Karrnath left farms and cities 
such as Shadukar devastated and abandoned, home only to the lingering 
undead left behind after the Karrnathi retreat.</p><p>For most, these 
grim reminders of war strengthen Thrane resolve. The common people are 
united by their faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause. The 
Silver Flame urges people to stand together in the face of evil, and 
across the nation, villagers work together to repair the damage 
inflicted during the war. People in a Thrane village regularly cooperate
 to raise a barn or practice archery in the fields.</p><p>The Silver 
Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often
 proves a more difficult challenge. Thrane has never forgiven Karrnath 
for its use of undead soldiers, and many Thranes are quick to imagine 
all Karrns as agents of darkness. Likewise, Thranes have bitter memories
 of the conflict with Aundair, and Aundairian wizards or eldritch 
knights receive a cold reception.</p><p>For most Thranes, the war 
strengthened their faith and drew them together. However, some question 
the validity of theocratic rule. Such doubt can be found even among the 
most devout followers of the faith; such people fear that the merging of
 temporal and spiritual authority distracts the church from its proper 
mission. If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek to restore
 Queen Diani to power.</p><p>Thaliost is another open wound. The Council
 of Cardinals is determined to hold onto this prize, but it is a bitter 
point of contention with Aundair and a constant source of tension and 
violence. In creating a Thrane character, consider how you feel about 
Thaliost. Would you like to see it returned to Aundair, or do you 
support Thrane's rule?</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="499" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Thronehold</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p128</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p><b>Capital</b>: Throneport</p><p><b>Hallmarks</b>: Entertainers, international intrigue, spies</p><p>After

established his seat of power on an island in Scions Sound. There he 
built the great castle of Thronehold.</p><p>After Jarot's death and the

control of small peacekeeping forces from Aundair, Breland, Karrnath,

 the midst of the Last War, an army of Tairnadal warrior elves from 
Aerenal seized this region from Cyre, invoking a claim to the land from 
long before humanity's arrival on the continent. The elves of Valenar 
devote themselves to the arts of war. Their cavalry has no equal in 
Khorvaire, and they combine a talent for magic with stealth and 
swordplay. Cyre employed the Valenar as mercenaries until the elves 
betrayed Cyre and took a corner of the nation for themselves. These 
lands escaped the destruction visited upon the rest of Cyre. After the 
Mourning, no one wanted to challenge the Valenar's claim to the land 
they had taken; in the interests of peace, the Treaty of Thronehold 
recognized the new elf kingdom of Valenar.</p><p>Valenar elves spend 
little time at rest, operating in small units called warbands. Those who
 aren't patrolling the kingdom travel abroad seeking adventure. 
Half-elves handle the civic administration. Some of these are the 
children of Valenar elves, but most are immigrants who've come from 
elsewhere in Khorvaire in search of opportunity. Cyran humans still 
occupying the region fall below them in rank. Once citizens of Cyre, now
 they're citizens of Valenar. Little has changed for the commoners, most
 of whom don't care who wears the crown.</p><p>The harsh sands of the

 chapter 1 for additional information about creating Valenar elves. When
 creating a Valenar character or NPC, consider the following:</p><p><b>Martial Role</b>.
 Valenar was forged in war. As an elf, consider your role in a warband. 
Are you a simple soldier, an acolyte devoted to the elven ancestors, or a
 sage familiar with your Valenar history? As a half-elf, you might be an
 entertainer, a sailor, or a guild artisan working to support the elf 
army, or you might be a charlatan seeking opportunities. As a human from
 Valenar, you could be an urchin born in Taer Valaestas, or a folk hero 
fighting for the common people.</p><p><b>Dreams</b>. Have you left 
Valenar behind, or are your aspirations tied to the new kingdom? As a 
half-elf with Valenar blood, do you want to be recognized as a true 
Valenar—granted a bond to a patron ancestor and a chance at 
immortality—or are you more interested in building a homeland for your 
people? As a human whose land the elves reclaimed, do you want to work 
with the elves or do you want to drive them out—and if so, who do you 
want to replace them?</p><p><b>Animal Companions</b>. Feytouched beasts 
play an important role in Valenar society. The Valenar are known for 
their steeds, but a wide range of Valenar beasts bond with non-elves. As
 a starting character, you might not have established a connection to a 
Valenar beast. If you return to Valenar later in your adventuring 
career, perhaps you will find your bondmate.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="506" data-title-relative-index="14"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cities and Sites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p129</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Most

 a popular saying in Taer Valaestas: "The shadow of war hangs long over 
Valenar." War defines Valenar culture. The Treaty of Thronehold 
recognized Valenar as a sovereign nation, but the elves are already 
pushing the limits of the treaty. Some venture into the Mournland or the
 untamed jungles of Q'barra, and Valenar warbands have launched raids 
into Darguun and Karrnath. High King Shaeras Vadallia has promised to 
rein in his warriors, but many believe that the elves will continue 
their provocation. Their main interest is conflict with a worthy foe—and
 they might want Darguun or Karrnath to declare war.</p><p>Because of 
this, the nation remains on a war footing. Villages find it challenging 
to produce the supplies required to maintain the elf army. Still, the 
Valenar are rarely cruel overlords. As long as a village can meet its

		</div></div><p></p><p>Zilargo isn't a tyranny. Each major city has a 
democratically elected ruling council and a seat on the Triumvirate that
 governs the nation; the Trust reports to the Triumvirate. The Zil 
gnomes built this system, and they are quite happy with it. Their 
streets are safe, and as long as you play by the rules of the game, the 
Trust ignores you. Outsiders find this casual acceptance of preemptive 
assassination to be terrifying, but the Zil genuinely trust the Trust.</p><p>Zil
 gnomes live within a web of intrigues. The Trust condones their 
actions, as long as they break no laws and don't threaten the state or 
the status quo. A gnome charlatan can connive to steal a jewel mine from
 another gnome—as long as the charlatan accomplishes the deed through 
cunning, negotiation, or deception rather than violence or outright 
theft, and as long as the mine stays in Zil hands. The same applies to 
adventurers planning schemes in Zilargo. Violence draws attention and 
deadly consequences from the Trust, but intrigue is perfectly 
acceptable.</p><p>The Trust is a network of spies and assassins. Most 
agents of the Trust simply pass information through dead drops; some 
estimate that a third of the nation works for the Trust in this 
capacity. When the Trust identifies a threat, it acts preemptively. 
Trust agents prefer to solve a problem without violence—by sharing a 
piece of information or a whispered warning sent via a <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#message_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="message_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">message</a>
 spell. But the Trust won't hesitate to eliminate a threat, whether with
 poison, spell, or blade. Typically, a target never sees the agent of 
their demise.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="512" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Interesting Things About Zilargo</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p131</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Most consider the Library of Korranberg the finest repository of knowledge in Khorvaire.</li><li class="rd__li ">The <i>Korranberg Chronicle</i> is the leading source of news in Khorvaire.

practice multiple religions.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="513" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Zil Characters</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p131</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As you develop a Zil character, consider the following factors:</p><p><b>Family Ties</b>.
 In a nation shaped by intrigue, you need someone you can rely on. For 
the Zil, that's family. Unless you're an orphan, discuss your family 
with your DM. What's their business? Who's your favorite relative? Are 
you currently involved in any family schemes? Family members might call 
on you for help over the course of your adventurers, but they can also 
be a resource for you.</p><p><b>Knowledge and Power</b>. The Zil prize 
knowledge above all else. Sage is a suitable background for any Zil; 
charlatan and spy are also appropriate, reflecting their love of 
intrigue. Classes that specialize in melee combat are rare among the 
Zil. The soldiers of Zilargo include rogues, bards, wizards, and 
artificers.</p><p><b>The Trust</b>. In creating a Zil character, 
consider whether you have any ties to the Trust. A vast number of gnomes
 serve as the eyes and ears of the Trust, reporting interesting 
information to a Trust handler. As an active agent, you could receive 
missions tied to your current adventures. If you and your companions are
 fighting the Emerald Claw, you might have a secondary assignment to 
eliminate a specific Claw agent or acquire a particular object from 
their base. While the spy background is a logical choice for a Trust 
agent, the agency recruits characters of every class and background. 
Your class abilities reflect specialized training and granted 
abilities—the magical equivalent of spy gadgets!</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="514" data-title-relative-index="15"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cities and Sites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p131</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

taller folk also exist. The Zil have a talent for illusion and for

 the streets of Korranberg, one might never know that the war occurred. 
Zilargo avoided most of the violence of the Last War, and cosmetic magic
 and illusions were employed to repair the few cities that suffered 
damage. Many Zil prefer to ignore the war completely, referring to it as
 "that unpleasantness to the north." Nonetheless, Zilargo was a staunch 
ally of Breland during the war, providing the nation with ships, 
intelligence, and elemental weaponry. This aid left the nation with 
enemies. The Order of the Emerald Claw has launched attacks on Zil 
communities, and certain cells of Breland's Swords of Liberty accuse the
 Zil of manipulating Breland. The Trust has contained these attacks, but
 it always anticipates more trouble ahead.</p><p>The jewel miners of 
eastern Zilargo often clash with the goblins of Darguun and the kobolds 
that live in Seawall Mountains. These skirmishes could expand into wider
 conflicts.</p><p>Overall, however, little has changed in Zilargo 
because the Trust keeps the nation on a steady path. Adventurers who 
travel through Zilargo would be wise to avoid causing trouble or drawing
 the Trust's attention.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="520" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chapter 2: Khorvaire Gazeteer - Distant Lands</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p132</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>This

 massive island of Aerenal is the ancient kingdom of the elves. Its 
jungles provide strange and valuable lumbers: soarwood used for the 
hulls of airships, tough bronzewood, and trees that remain alive after 
being felled.</p><p>The island's proximity to the planes of Irian and Mabar (both described in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,10">chapter 4</a>)
 allows the lines between life and death to become blurred. Dangerous, 
dark forces creep in from the plane known as the Endless Night, but that
 planar resonance also enables the elves to perform feats of necromancy 
unmatched elsewhere in Eberron. Among the Aereni elves, the honored dead
 walk among the living. Heroes who died in glorious battle return to 
serve the Sibling Kings. And in the depths of Shae Mordai, the deathless
 lords of the Undying Court study the shifting balance of the planes and
 the path of the Draconic Prophecy.</p><p>Necromancy is a pillar of 
Aereni society, distinct from the sinister power most adventurers 
encounter. Positive energy sustains the deathless undead of Aerenal—both
 the light of Irian and the devotion freely given by their descendants. 
The elves of Aerenal despise necromancy that draws on the negative 
energy of Mabar, and agents of the Undying Court embrace their mandate 
to seek out and destroy vampires, liches, and other such undead.</p><p>Aereni
 civilization is over twenty thousand years old. Secure in their island 
sanctuary, the elves watched nations of goblins and humans rise and 
fall. The Aereni possess secrets and powers the rest of Khorvaire has 
yet to discover, but they are more interested in perfecting their 
ancient traditions than in innovation and discovery. An Aereni wizard 
might spend a decade refining the pronunciation of a single spell's 
incantation. For now, humanity can't match the power of the elves. If 
that balance changes, will Aerenal take action?</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="524">

 the Grand Temple and look down upon the High Street and you'll see 
fountains of light casting shadows across buildings that have stood for 
over ten thousand years. Brilliant motes dance through the air—spectral 
messengers carrying words across the city. But the most remarkable 
feature of Pylas Talaear is the dead. If you know anything about 
Aerenal, you've surely heard of the Undying Court, the deathless cabinet
 that guides the nation. Only the grandest members of society win 
elevation to the Undying Court, but there are many forms of 
preservation. Go to the Dalaen Forge and you'll see the ghost of Old 
Dalaen advising his descendants as they work wood and steel. Visit the 
Eidolon Tavern and you'll see poltergeists mixing drinks, and you can 
get advice from a spectral bartender with thousands of years of wisdom 
to share. Visit Maer Crossing at midnight and you'll see the spirit of 
Lady Jhaelian dance with a grace unmatched by any living elf.</p><p>Wondrous
 as it is, as a human visitor, I found it more than a little unnerving. 
There's no escaping the past in Aerenal; it lingers all around you, 
whispering advice or warning you to avoid transgression. You never know 
when you'll feel the tingle of spectral fingers against your skin or 
hear the whisper of an elf who's older than human civilization. There 
are many wonders in Aerenal... just don't get buried in the past.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="527" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Pylas Talaear</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p133</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The

industrialized than Khorvaire. Legendary items aren't mass produced; 
some are personally crafted by members of the Undying Court.</p><p>Aereni
 goods make use of exotic plants and woods. Bronzewood has the density 
and even some of the properties of steel; an Aereni cleric might wear a 
bronzewood breastplate, while a paladin of the Undying Court could wear a
 suit of elaborated engraved bronzewood plate armor. Bronzewood leaves 
are remarkably tough, and the Aereni craft "leaf weave" armor 
functionally equivalent to leather, studded leather, or chain mail.

 is home to the oldest civilization on Eberron. The dragons wield 
ancient magic, and they have shielded their homeland against divination

coastlines of Argonnessen; these include members of almost every 
humanoid race, perhaps collected by dragons in ages past. The Seren 
barbarians worship the dragons and protect the coasts from invaders. To 
date, no one from Khorvaire has ventured into the interior of the 
continent and returned to speak of it.</p><p>No one knows how many 
dragons live in Argonnessen, but stories tell of vast cavern complexes 
filled with the treasures of fallen civilizations, of prisons holding 
bound demons, of cities made from adamantine.</p><p>To those of

 say the mysterious dragons of Argonnessen hide in plain sight, that

 younger races from vile fiends. In other tales, the dragons see the 
people of Khorvaire as fodder for arcane experiments. A dragon could be 
encountered as an ally or as a cruel enemy who casually crushes 
humanoids.</p><p>The magic of Argonnessen is far more powerful than the 
forces wielded by the wizards of Khorvaire. Many of the greatest

 common creation myth contends that when the Progenitor Dragons fought, 
Eberron trapped Khyber in her coils and became the world, imprisoning 
her evil sibling in a living prison. Bound within the world, Khyber 
spawns demons and monsters to plague the children of Eberron. This might
 be myth and metaphor, but it's also a description of fact: there are 
worlds within the world, realms inhabited by aberrations, fiends, and 
all manner of monsters.</p><p>Any time someone descends below the 
surface of the world, they enter Khyber. But the underworld takes two 
very different forms. First is the natural realm, networks of tunnels 
and caverns formed from stone and soil. These passages are dark and 
dangerous, but they're exactly what you expect to find in an underground
 realm. Such passages might be home to carrion crawlers, giant beetles, 
or clans of kobolds. But ultimately these mundane caverns follow the 
laws of nature.</p><p>There's another aspect to Khyber: go deep enough 
and you find a seemingly endless array of demiplanes, each stranger than
 the last. When descending into a chasm, you could find a labyrinth 
inhabited by demons or discover a realm consisting of the guts of a 
colossal living creature. Anything is possible in Khyber, and these 
"worlds within" are home to all manner of terrors.</p><p>The demiplanes 
of Khyber are not concretely tied to the world above. You could discover
 a passage in Breland that leads into a disturbing subterranean swamp 
filled with oozes and slimes. After traveling what seems to be a few 
miles, you might emerge from a different tunnel in Xen'drik, half a 
world away from where you began.</p><p>The Mror Holds demonstrate this 
mystery. Over the past century, the dwarves discovered a vast 
subterranean kingdom within the Ironroot Mountains. Most of these halls 
rest in the natural layers of Khyber. The halls connect to one another 
in logical cartographic order. But as the ancient dwarves dug deeper, 
they opened passages into the unnatural realms and unleashed the hordes 
of the daelkyr <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#dyrrn_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="dyrrn_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Dyrrn</a> the Corruptor.

 realm also exist in the Shadow Marches, on the opposite side of 
Khorvaire. The Corruptor's domain doesn't necessarily stretch across the
 entire world; the portals to the worlds within defy natural law.</p><p>These
 connections impact the world in a number of ways. Dark forces can rise 
anywhere in the world, bursting out of a previously unknown portal to 
Khyber. This fact dictates the primary mission of the Church of the 
Silver Flame: to stand ready to defend the innocent from such unnatural 
threats. Because the demiplanes connect to the world at random, you 
never know what you might find when you venture into the depths. A newly
 opened chasm in the sewers could be an entirely mundane hole in the 
ground, or it could be a passage to the Abyssal Forests of Khar.</p><p>The
 many layers of Khyber share similarity only in their strangeness and 
deadliness. Eberron is the natural world; Khyber is the source of fiends
 and monstrosities and the domain of the alien daelkyr. Some cults of 
the Dragon Below believe that paradise awaits them in the Vale of the 
Inner Sun, but such cultists also consider gibbering mouthers and mind 
flayers to be creatures of beauty. Wondrous treasures might wait in the 
worlds below amid hordes of demons and aberrations.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="537" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Khyber's Influence in Khorvaire</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p135</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In Khorvaire, you might...</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Find a way to close a passage to Khyber before a horde of horrors emerges from it.</li><li class="rd__li ">Battle a mind flayer that has established a cult in the sewers.</li><li class="rd__li ">Stop the spread of a deadly drug or strange disease flowing from a well tied to Khyber.</li></ul><p>Khyber
 is an ever-present threat. Any deep passage could connect to a realm of
 fiends or spew out an army of aberrations. Despite the magnitude of 
this threat, portals to Khyber are very rare, and they are stable once 
found. If you dig a hole in the ground, the odds that you'll eventually 
reach the Vale of the Inner Sun are infinitesimal. And if a portal to 
Khyber existed in the sewers of Fairhaven, odds are good that it would 
already have been discovered. The risk arises when you're exploring 
passages where no one has gone before. The sewers of Fairhaven might be 
safe today, but if an earthquake opens a new shaft or a group of 
cultists digs deeper, a previously unknown passage to Khyber could be 
uncovered. Wherever a passage to Khyber appears, monsters and dark 
powers can rise up to threaten the world above.</p><p>Cults of the Dragon Below often have ties to Khyber. Some serve aberrations or fight alongside dolgrims and dolgaunts (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>).
 Others can unintentionally threaten a community by releasing something 
from the underworld: an unnatural disease, a malevolent demon, or a 
strange and addictive drug. In dealing with such a cult, the question is
 not only how to stop their current machinations, but how to seal the 
passage or prevent it from posing an ongoing threat.</p><p>Treasures from Khyber can take many forms. The daelkyr create living tools, including symbionts (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12">chapter 5</a>), but any magic item could be presented as an organic creation: a living <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#cape%20of%20the%20mountebank_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="cape%20of%20the%20mountebank_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">cloak of the mountebank</a> that teleports its wearer through the plane of madness; a <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#dagger%20of%20venom_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="dagger%20of%20venom_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">dagger of venom</a> made from chitin and muscle, similar to a scorpion's barb; a <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#crystal%20ball_dmg" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="DMG" data-vet-hash="crystal%20ball_dmg" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">crystal ball</a> made by the daelkyr <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#belashyrra_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="belashyrra_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Belashyrra</a>

 common knowledge that Everice is the domain of the Queen of Winter, an 
archfey who commands a host of winter wolves and knights carved from 
living ice. The queen lives in a glacial palace, and those who overcome 
her guards and the deadly weather to earn her favor can gain powerful 
boons.</p><p>It's also common knowledge that Everice is the home of 
frost giants who escaped the destruction of Xen'drik. Now they hone 
their arctic magic and plot vengeance. However, a clan of white dragons 
battle the giants to keep them from growing too powerful. Woe betide the
 people of Khorvaire if dragon and giant ever set aside their ancient 
vendetta and join forces!</p><p>The Frostfell is thought to be the 
original homeland of the dwarves, and some believe that an ancient 
nation of dwarves still thrives under the ice. Others say that the 
Frostfell was once a verdant realm until the dwarves uncovered the 
prison of an archfiend, which buried their nation under endless ice. 
These scholars warn against disturbing this overlord, lest a new age of 
ice be unleashed across the entire world.</p><p>Mystery shrouds the

 was once home to over a dozen distinct kingdoms, but wars devastated 
the continent. From this chaos, a band of saviors rose up to forge a new
 world. Guided by celestial spirits and endowed with vast psionic 
powers, these champions became known as the Inspired. Today, the 
Inspired have united the broken nations into a single realm: the Empire 
of Riedra. Outsiders aren't welcome in Riedra, and little is known of 
the nation. Merchants tell stories of massive monoliths that control the
 dreams of the people, and of secret police who use psionics to root out
 dissidents.</p><p>A single nation stands against the might of Riedra: the mountain refuge of Adar, homeland of the kalashtar (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,1">chapter 1</a>).

 I first spoke to the Morgrave board, I hid the details I share with you
 now. I did this not from malice, nor even from fear that I would be 
ridiculed, but rather because I could not bear to revisit the horrors I 
had seen beneath the merciless Menechtarun sands. I force myself to 
revisit them now only in the hopes that in so doing, I can prevent any 
fools from following in our footsteps and sharing the fate of my fallen 
friends.</p><p>We'd made camp in the upper floor of the tower, for 
thousands of years of shifting sand had left that as the easiest point 
of entry. We were surrounded by cyclopean bones, and I found myself 
facing the empty gaze of a skull taller than I was. Melanora questioned 
how these grim remnants could linger for so long, but I dismissed it as 
the remarkable effect of the exceptionally dry climate. If only I had 
given more thought to this matter, Melanora might still be with us 
today. Instead she lies lost beneath the basalt towers, trapped in 
hideous service to the ancient powers that dwell in the darkness.</p><p>For the full text of Professor Talbridge's terrifying account, pick up the latest issue of the Sharn Inquisitive!</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="546" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dar Jin</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p137</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>This

the Inspired. To enter Riedra proper, travelers must obtain a transit

 built its empire on the foundation of a dozen shattered nations. 
Scholars consider the loss of these nations to be a tragedy... except 
for Ohr Kaluun. The lords of this ancient kingdom were driven by deep 
paranoia and an all-consuming thirst for power. The sages of Ohr Kaluun 
studied the darkest paths of magic and bargained with fiends and other 
foul creatures. They warped their bodies through mystical rituals and 
pacts, creating the first changelings, skulks, and tiefling bloodlines. 
Ohr Kaluun was ultimately consumed by the feuds of its paranoid 
mage-lords and the crusading legions of its neighbors. Today, it is a 
shunned region, haunted and cursed. Dark secrets and great treasures 
remain in the vast war labyrinths of Ohr Kaluun, but fiends, wards, and 
far deadlier threats linger in this fallen kingdom.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="549" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sarlona's Influence in Khorvaire</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p138</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In Khorvaire, you might...</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Struggle to expose the schemes of an order of psychic assassins.</li><li class="rd__li ">Steal a memory crystal from an Inspired ambassador.</li><li class="rd__li ">Help an Adaran envoy deliver a vital message to a kalashtar elder.</li></ul><p>Although
 outsiders aren't welcome in Riedra, the empire is a powerful nation and
 a valuable trading partner. Riedra offered assistance to multiple 
nations during the Last War. Karrnath relied on Riedran aid to survive a
 wave of terrible famines, and Aundair also received support from 
Riedra. King Sebastes of Q'barra has used Riedran troops to maintain 
order in Newthrone.</p><p>Riedrans rarely appear on the streets of 
Khorvaire, but Inspired ambassadors attend every court. Although the 
Inspired present themselves as generous and kind, a darker force 
followed them across the sea. The Dreaming Dark is an enigmatic order of
 monks, assassins, warlocks, and mystics. Their ultimate agenda remains 
unknown, but they hunt the kalashtar and some believe they can control 
people by manipulating their dreams. While most people dismiss the 
Dreaming Dark as a foolish story, you might uncover the truth behind the

 follower of the Sovereign Host knows this story about Xen'drik. In the 
dawn of time, the Sovereigns bound the fiendish overlords and freed the 
world from chaos. The mighty giants had fought alongside the Sovereigns,
 and in gratitude Aureon granted them dominion over the continent of 
Xen'drik. Aureon taught giants the secrets of wizardry, and they grew 
powerful. The giants built towers that touched the sky and seemingly 
endless cities.</p><p>The mightiest among the giants was the titan 
Cul'sir. His power was so great that he pulled the thirteenth moon from 
the sky and crushed it in a fit of anger. The giants ruled many lesser 
races, and eventually the elves rose up against them. Cul'sir unleashed 
plagues upon the rebellious elves. He made assassins of elven shadows 
and turned them back against their owners. Still the rebels persisted. 
In his anger, Cul'sir prepared to pull down the rest of the moons to 
hurl them at his enemies, even though he'd destroy the world in doing 
it. But the giants had gone too far, and Aureon set the dragons of 
Argonnessen upon them. The dragons destroyed the vast cities and leveled
 the towers. Cul'sir was slain and his people scattered.</p><p>The 
Sovereigns and Six each laid a curse upon the land. Aureon decreed that 
the creatures of Xen'drik would have no knowledge of law, and Boldrei 
proclaimed that no city would stand. The Traveler distorted the land so 
that no path followed twice. The Devourer unleashed fire and storm. And 
so Xen'drik remains a land of mystery, a realm that cannot be mapped, a 
place that holds secrets that could shatter the world.</p><p>This story 
bears at least some truth. The elves were once slaves of the ancient 
giants, and the dragons did eradicate the civilizations of Xen'drik. 
Great magic has warped the land. The environments of Xen'drik are 
extreme and unpredictable, and travelers might find a glacial expanse in
 the midst of a vast desert. Tens of thousands of years have passed, yet
 no civilization has risen to the heights of the fallen giants; some 
believe that Aureon's and Boldrei's curses ensure that any city that 
grows too large collapses into madness. The Traveler's Curse twists 
space, and explorers might follow the same path twice only to end up in 
entirely different locations.</p><p>Xen'drik is a continent that defies 
control. Expeditions have unearthed artifacts of immense power, as well 
as fields of Siberys dragonshards (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12">chapter 5</a>), but once you leave a site, you might never find it again.</p><p>Giants
 still roam Xen'drik, but these creatures have never regained the glory 
of their ancestors. Tribes of drow—said to be the shadow-assassins 
created by the Emperor Cul'sir—linger in the darkness. These represent 
just a few of the threats in this vast land.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="554" data-title-relative-index="2"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Notable Locations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p139</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Many
 ports dot the coast of Xen'drik. In addition to the treasures of the 
giants, Xen'drik is a source of Siberys dragonshards and other exotic 
resources. Scholars and merchants come to Xen'drik on business, 
smugglers seek to make extra gold, and pirates prey on everyone. Ports 
come and go, falling prey to monsters or natural disasters. But two 
harbors have stood the test of time.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="555" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dar Qat.</span></span> <p>The
 Inspired lords of Riedra are just as interested in the resources of 
Xen'drik as the people of Khorvaire. Dar Qat is a Riedran port, a 
fortress built from glittering crysteel (grown crystal as strong as 
steel) and dwarfed by a nearby monolith believed to serve as a psychic 
anchor for the city. Outsiders are rarely welcome within the walls of 
Dar Qat.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="556" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Stormreach.</span></span> <p>Once
 a haven for pirates and smugglers, Stormreach has become a thriving 
port that serves as the passage to the Xen'drik interior. All the 
dragonmarked houses have outposts in the city, and it is home to 
refugees, renegades, criminals, and others who have no place on the 
other continents. The city is ruled by the council of Storm Lords, who 
hold absolute power. As Stormreach is built on the foundations of an 
ancient giant city, ruins abound around and below the city. Some fear 
that if the city continues to expand, the growth will trigger an ancient
 curse. But for now, Stormreach is a prosperous community and a gateway 
to adventure.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="557" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Xen'drik's Influence in Khorvaire</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p140</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In Khorvaire, you might...</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Befriend a drow making their way in the new world.</li><li class="rd__li ">Stop the Emerald Claw from using a giant artifact to destroy a city.</li><li class="rd__li ">Aid a scholar in deciphering a book of prophecy found in the heart of Xen'drik and brought to Stormreach.</li></ul><p>The
 tremendous diversity of the people of Xen'drik means that no single 
trait defines objects and artifacts from this land. The primitive drow 
make armor comparable to studded leather using the chitin of giant 
scorpions. Rumors abound of more advanced drow civilizations in the 
layers of Khyber that lie beneath Xen'drik. The elves lived and fought 
in Xen'drik before the exodus that took them to Aerenal, and elven 
artifacts remain scattered across the region. And the grandest treasures
 include the work of the giants—which can often be difficult to use 
because of their size. The spellbook of a giant wizard might hold 
priceless secrets, but the bulky tome can be quite awkward for smaller 
folk.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="558">Trinkets from Xen'drik</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 plays an important role in Eberron. The gods don't manifest physically,

Shared beliefs unite communities and can provide hope in difficult

 Host and its malign shadow, the Dark Six. The Sovereign Host was the 
dominant faith of the Kingdom of Galifar and holds sway over most of 
Khorvaire—except for Thrane, which favors the Church of the Silver 
Flame. Other religions connect specific cultures or communities; the 
kalashtar observe the Path of Light, and the Undying Court guides the 
elves of Aerenal.</p><p>Religion is especially important for a paladin, 
cleric, or druid, yet any character can have faith in a higher power.

or instinct, you see as the voice of the Sovereigns offering guidance. 
You don't need absolute proof; the fact of a bountiful harvest is 
evidence of Arawai's benevolence.</li></ul><p>The pantheon of the 
Sovereign Host embodies all that is good in the world. The people of 
Khorvaire have followed the Sovereigns for thousands of years, and 
everyone knows the names of the Sovereigns and the Dark Six. Even people
 who aren't devout might still swear by the Sovereigns or offer a prayer
 in a moment of crisis.</p><p>The Sovereign Host is wondrously diverse. 
Variations and subsects of the faith thrive, and temples are only 
loosely aligned. In a small community, a skilled smith might double as 
the priest because people believe he's close to Onatar. A midwife might 
symbolically speak for Arawai and Boldrei. Typically, the faithful are 
united by their shared beliefs; no central authority seeks to enforce a 
singular creed.</p><p>As a Vassal—a follower of the Sovereign Host—you 
might feel connection to a particular Sovereign, but still show 
reverence to each. Your background can influence your particular 
interpretation of the Sovereigns—the Talenta halflings consider the 
Sovereigns part of a pantheon of spirits, while some Karrns honor only 
the Sovereigns of war—but any character can be a Vassal.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="571" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sovereigns</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p141</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>These common names and attributes describe the nine Sovereigns as they are worshiped in Khorvaire:</p><p><b>Arawai</b>
 is the Sovereign of Life and Love. She is the patron of fertility and 
of the benevolent aspects of nature, bringing good harvest and gentle 
rain.</p><p><b>Aureon</b> is the Sovereign of Law and Lore. He is considered the first wizard, who shared the secrets of wizardry with the world.</p><p><b>Balinor</b>
 is the Sovereign of Horn and Hunt. He guides both the beast and the 
hunter, and he is the patron of those who walk on the edge of 
civilization and the natural world.</p><p><b>Boldrei</b> is the 
Sovereign of Hall and Hearth. She guides and protects communities and 
families, inspiring people to work together for the common good.</p><p><b>Dol Arrah</b>
 is the sun that drives away the darkness. She stands for wisdom in war 
and for those who fight with honor, pursue justice, and make sacrifices 
for the greater good.</p><p><b>Dol Dorn</b> is the Sovereign of Strength
 and Steel. He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the 
hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, and 
martial skill.</p><p><b>Kol Korran</b> is the Sovereign of World and 
Wealth. He guards travelers and guides traders. Although the Trickery 
domain is suggested for his clerics, Kol Korran guides fair negotiation;
 those driven solely by greed prefer the Keeper of the Dark Six.</p><p><b>Olladra</b>
 is the Sovereign of Feast and Fortune. She is the giver of joy and the 
granter of luck, patron to entertainers, gamblers, and anyone who takes a
 chance.</p><p><b>Onatar</b> is the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He 
guides both mundane smiths and artificers, inspiring anyone who performs
 an act of creation.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="572" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Symbol</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p142</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

Sovereigns whose favor they seek. There are eight points in the symbol

 Dark Six are the shadows of the Sovereign Host. These dark gods shape 
the world and are present at all times, speaking to those willing to

Yet correspondents at the <i>Voice of Thrane</i> have uncovered a shocking phenomenon: long-standing cults that worship members of the Dark Six alongside the Sovereign Host.</p><p>Most
 of you know of the Restful Watch, the priests who tend Vassal 
cemeteries. What you may not know is that the priests of the Watch honor
 both Aureon and the Keeper! They say that the Keeper snatches the souls
 of heroes so they can be preserved from Dolurrh and returned when they 
are needed once more.</p><p>Worse still is the Three Faces of War, a 
cult that worships the Sovereigns of War—including the Mockery, whom 
they call Dol Azur. Followers of this foul faith say that the 
battlefield holds a place for all of these gods, explicitly embracing a 
deity they acknowledge as the patron of treachery and terror! This cult 
apparently began in the Karrnathi military but spread across the Five 
Nations during the Last War. So next time you're talking to a Brelish 
soldier, remember that they might be a devotee of the Mockery!</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>The
 Dark Six and the Sovereign Host are opposite sides of the same coin. If
 you believe in one, you acknowledge the existence of the other. The 
only question is whether you fear the Six or revere them. Those who 
choose to follow these sinister deities embrace darkness. A barbarian 
may thank the Fury for the gift of rage. An assassin walks the path of 
the Mockery, while a warlock's pact may be a gift of the Shadow.</p><p>The
 Dark Six inspire worship in different ways among diverse cultures. 
Temples to the Dark Six appear in Droaam, along with wild revels driven 
by the Fury. The Dark Six aren't worshiped openly elsewhere in 
Khorvaire; the gods' shrines are hidden, and it's more common to find a 
cult devoted to a single member of the Six than a temple dedicated to 
the entire pantheon.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="577" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Six</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p143</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>These common names and attributes describe the Dark Six as they are known in Khorvaire:</p><p><b>The Devourer</b> governs the destructive power of nature, both pure elemental force and savagery in beasts.</p><p><b>The Keeper</b>
 snatches souls before they can reach Dolurrh and hoards them along with
 his vast wealth. Those driven by greed call him their patron, and his 
priests often act as criminal fixers.</p><p><b>The Fury</b> governs both
 passion and revenge, rage and despair. She offers revenge to those who 
have been wronged, but her vengeance often leads to suffering.</p><p><b>The Mockery</b>
 is the patron of treachery and of terror in battle. He guides those who
 seek victory through guile, both warriors and assassins. He was once 
the brother of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, but he was stripped of his skin 
and his name after betraying them.</p><p><b>The Shadow</b> is the dark 
side of knowledge and ambition. It's said to be Aureon's shadow, given 
malign life when Aureon mastered magic. The Shadow is the maker of 
monsters and the keeper of forbidden secrets, and it offers malevolent 
spells to warlocks and wizards.</p><p><b>The Traveler</b> asserts that 
chaos drives evolution and that change makes us stronger. The Traveler 
is a trickster and the giver of dangerous gifts. Some artificers worship
 the Traveler, seeing it as the lord of innovation, but the gifts of the
 Traveler always have unexpected consequences.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="578" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Symbol</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p143</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Hexagram represents the entire pantheon of the Dark Six. The Deities of
 Eberron table lists the common symbols of the individual gods. However,
 since the Six aren't worshiped openly in most of Khorvaire, each sect 
chooses a unique symbol based on the nature of their god. Followers of 
the Devourer might carry a shark's tooth or a piece of wood scorched in a
 wildfire. A Keeper cult might use the nine-sided coin of Kol Korran 
with the face disfigured. A particular sect uses these symbols 
consistently, if not obviously.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="579" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Rites</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p143</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 called by the Silver Flame and battled the mighty fiend. When it became

 nation of Thrane shocked the world in 993 YK when it appointed a 
six-year-old child as Keeper of the Silver Flame, the supreme leadership
 position of the Church. Now eleven years old, Jaela Daran continues to 
astound all who encounter her. She possesses poise and wisdom beyond her
 years, and she displays the blend of courage and compassion that is the
 cornerstone of the faith. As Keeper of the Flame, she wields tremendous
 divine power; she has summoned angels to her side and resurrected 
Cardinal Halidor after his assassination.</p><p>But some claim that 
these stories are fabrications and that Jaela is merely a figurehead for
 High Cardinal Krozen. The reclusive Krozen is a brilliant strategist 
and ruthless leader. Many believe that Krozen was behind the death of 
Keeper Tagor in 992 YK, suggesting that he supported the child Keeper to
 solidify his own influence. Is Krozen the true power behind the Flame?</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>A
 pillar of argent fire marks the point of Tira's sacrifice, the center 
of the modern church. This pillar, located in Flamekeep, is a 
manifestation of the Silver Flame, not the source of its power.</p><p>The
 church's templars stand ready to protect the innocent from supernatural
 threats, battling undead, fiends, and aberrations. Friars and ministers
 fight evil by doing good, performing acts of compassion and charity 
across Khorvaire. In contrast to the Sovereign Host, the church 
maintains a defined structure and creed. Archbishops monitor regions; 
cardinals lead the church; and the ultimate authority is the Keeper of 
the Flame, who maintains the font in Flamekeep and communes with Tira 
Miron.</p><p>The Last War had a serious impact on the church. Leaders 
still respected the Keeper's authority over spiritual matters, but the 
war wasn't about good or evil. Templars of all nations still joined 
together to fight demons, but if no supernatural threat was present, 
they fought for their own nations. This division allowed cracks to form 
in the foundation. In Breland, some priests fell prey to greed or forged
 ties to criminal organizations. In Aundair, a zealous faction known as 
the Pure Flame advocates using violence rather than compassion as the 
primary tool for rooting out evil. And in Thrane, the church has become 
the ruling body. While still driven by Tira's principles of redemption 
and sacrifice, the intrusion of politics means that some come to the 
faith seeking power rather than purely to do good.</p><p>In creating a 
follower of the Silver Flame, decide whether you are bound to the church
 or simply inspired by its principles. As a paladin, are you part of the
 templar order, or were you a farmer called to action by the Voice of 
the Silver Flame?</p><p>The Silver Flame is centered in Thrane, but it 
has a strong presence in Breland and Aundair, and followers across 
Khorvaire. Members of the Pure Flame sect treat some species—notably 
shifters and changelings—with suspicion, but the faith holds that people
 of all races should stand together.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="583" data-title-relative-index="2"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Symbol</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p144</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 month, the Emerald Claw took credit for the ghoul outbreak in Wroat. 
This terrorist organization has a new and unusual critic: Hask 
Malevanor, an "abactor" of the Blood of Vol and high priest of the 
Crimson Monastery, a temple in the city of Atur in Karrnath. Something 
else you should know about Abactor Malevanor: he's been dead for over 
fifty years! This putrid priest says that there's nothing unholy about 
his condition, swearing that his people revere all life. Despite the 
fact that the terrorists included priests from his church, Malevanor 
insists that his parishioners despise the Emerald Claw and harbor no 
hostility toward Breland.</p><p>While we'd like to take the abactor at 
his word, our research shows that Malevanor was personally involved in 
the program that produced the infamous Karrnathi undead soldiers. After 
decades of driving the Karrnathi war effort, this foul creature expects 
us to believe that he has nothing to do with the necromantic attacks on 
our people? Here at the <i>Voice of Breland</i>, we think something about this smells rotten, and it's not just the mummy.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>What
 just god would allow death and suffering? The Blood of Vol teaches that
 we all have the potential to become divine beings—and that death is a 
curse, designed to kill you before you can unlock the divinity within 
you.</p><p>The Blood of Vol is a grim faith, founded by Erandis d'Vol, 
an elf from Aerenal. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the 
universe is uncaring, and that if the Sovereigns exist, they are cruel. 
Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they 
believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the 
bodies of the fallen to serve the living. Seekers of the Divinity Within
 (as the faithful call themselves) are glad to be reanimated after 
death; at least they can do some good.</p><p>Because of this association
 with necromancy, many believe the Blood of Vol embraces death and its 
followers want to become undead. Both ideas are false. The Blood of Vol 
sees death as the ultimate evil. Seekers don't want to become undead; 
they want to become divine beings. The faith teaches that divinity is 
tied to blood and soul, and the undead can never fully harness that 
power. The mummies and vampires of the Blood of Vol have sacrificed 
their chance at divinity to guide the living. They're martyrs, not 
something to envy.</p><p>In addition to a general revulsion toward the 
undead, the public opinion of the Blood of Vol is colored by the actions
 of the Order of the Emerald Claw. This extremist sect serves a lich 
known as the Queen of Death, and it employs necromantic magic in acts of
 terror. However, most Seekers don't support the Emerald Claw.</p><p>The
 Blood of Vol has its strongest following in Karrnath and the Lhazaar 
Principalities. For a time, it was the national religion of Karrnath. 
Though fallen from favor, the faith is still practiced openly in that 
nation.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="588" data-title-relative-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Symbol</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p145</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

are based on madness or power. A cult that seeks power chooses to serve a
 dark force because of the gifts they receive from it. A cabal of

 and Kyrzin. Membership in such a cult is voluntary, and spellcasters 
are more likely to be warlocks or wizards than clerics; their power 
comes from bargaining, not from faith.</p><p>Cults driven by madness 
have a warped view of reality. A cultist might believe aberrations are a
 higher form of life and that the daelkyr will elevate mortals. Other 
cultists may not recognize the true nature of the beings they serve. A 
cult of <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rak%20tulkhesh_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="rak%20tulkhesh_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Rak Tulkhesh</a>
 might truly believe their lord will bring peace to the world, even if 
that peace must begin with bloody war. Joining such a cult isn't a 
choice, it's something you fall into due to madness. New cults can 
spring up anywhere, as seeds of madness take root and spread.</p><p>Cults
 of the Dragon Below often appear as antagonists. However, your 
character could be a member of a relatively benign cult. You might have 
been raised in a cult but broke free from its influence. If your 
character was or is part of a cult, work with your DM to develop the

 by many kalashtar, the Path of Light seeks to change reality by first 
bringing change within, using meditation to focus the mind and athletic 
discipline to improve the body. The next step brings light into the 
world, using courage and compassion to banish the darkness in the people
 around you. Mediate disputes. Extinguish hatred by guiding people out 
of darkness. Inspire people to be better than they are. Even the 
smallest change is a victory, yet lightbringers—the followers of this 
path—hope that this is merely a step on a greater journey.</p><p>The 
Path of Light teaches that this age is dominated by il-Lashtavar, "the 
great darkness that dreams." This force poisons the world and promotes 
darkness. But all things change. If enough light can enter the world, it
 will lead to a tidal shift: the age of il-Lashtavar will end and usher 
in the time of il-Yannah, the great light.</p><p>Some followers of this 
faith believe that meditation alone is sufficient to change the path of 
the world, that merely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring 
about the change. Most believe that it is necessary to take action, but 
that darkness must fought with light. Violence is never the answer, and 
the only way to defeat evil is to redeem it. Lightbringers seek to 
inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those whose evil is driven 
by ignorance. The faith has followed this path for over a thousand 
years, but now a splinter sect advocates greater action. These shadow 
watchers believe that evil must be fought, that sources of darkness that
 poison communities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.</p><p>The 
Path of Light is taught to the kalashtar by the spirits bound to their 
bloodlines. It is widespread in the nation of Adar in distant Sarlona, 
but in Khorvaire, it is largely unknown outside kalashtar communities. 
The shadow watchers champion a sect born in Khorvaire, and the elders of
 Adar have condemned its methods.</p><p>If you follow the Path of Light,

 of the people of Khorvaire have never met a kalashtar. Some say these 
people are in contact with celestial spirits; here at the <i>Voice of Breland</i>,
 we say they're a rare type of lunatic we've imported from Sarlona. So 
it was a special treat for tourists when one of the spiritual leaders of
 the kalashtar of Sharn made an unexpected appearance in the grand plaza
 of Hope's Peak. The enlightened Havakhad—that's what he calls 
himself—issued a warning that "darkness was gathering" and that "a 
terrible time lies just ahead." He beseeched the assembled crowds to 
show kindness to neighbor and stranger alike, and not to let "fear cause
 strife in the hard days to come." Apparently Havakhad hasn't heard the 
news that we're winning the war. But if the world does end tomorrow, you
 read it here first!</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>As a 
Tairnadal elf of Valenar, you were raised on the legends of your people,
 on tales of champions who battled mighty dragons and armies of giants. 
When you came of age, the Keepers of the Past read the signs to 
determine which of these ancestors chose you to be their vessel. Since 
that day, it has been your duty to emulate your patron ancestor. If 
you're a wizard, you've studied the spells created by your ancestor. If 
you're a warrior, you've practiced their specific martial techniques. 
When you trance, you relive their greatest battles. But these studies 
are just preparation. Now it's your sacred duty to be a revenant of your
 ancestor: to live your life as they did and allow the champion to walk 
the world again through you. (This title of revenant carried by Speakers
 of the Past is not to be confused with the undead revenants described 
in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#MM">Monster Manual</a>.)</p><p>The
 bond between ancestor and living elf is holy. Your ancestor doesn't 
speak to you or control your actions. But as a Tairnadal, you believe 
that they are with you—that your instincts and your reflexes are the 
ancestor moving through you, telling you what to do. The closer you 
follow the path, the more guidance they provide, helping you create new 
legends.</p><p>The folk of Khorvaire see your people as mercenaries and 
conquerors. But you don't care about gold or personal glory. All you 
want is to let your ancestors live again, and that means you need to 
perform deeds worthy of champions. That drives you now: seeking out 
adventures that will add to the legends of your patron.</p><p>You and 
your DM should develop the identity of your ancestor. How did they 
fight? What were some of their legendary deeds? Did they have a 
distinctive weapon or favor a particular kind of magic? Equally 
important is your relationship with the ancestor. Are you proud of your 
ancestor and excited to live as they did, or is your duty a burden?</p><p>Since
 the rise of Valenar, half-elves and even some humans have sought to be 
inducted into the faith. But so far the Keepers of the Past have 
declared that only elves can be revenants. Beyond the blood connection 
to the ancestor, an elf communes with their ancestor during trance, and 
half-elves can't enter this state. The Keepers say it can't be done, but
 perhaps you'll be the one to prove them wrong.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="602" data-title-relative-index="6"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Symbol</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p147</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

or performing rituals, so an opponent sees the zaelshin rather than the 
living elf.</p><p>The zaelshin is the symbol of the faith, but the holy

generates a well of mystic energy that empowers their clerics. As an 
Aereni cleric, your spells aren't personally granted to you by a 
specific Undying Councilor. Your powers flow from the Court itself, 
allowing you to serve its will and to protect your people.</p><p>Of all 
the religions of Eberron, the Undying Court is most grounded in the 
world. The Court stands in the city of Shae Mordai, and as an Aerenal 
elf, you could seek an audience with one of your deathless ancestors. As
 a devotee of the Undying Court, you recognize it as the power that 
sustains your civilization and as an assembly of your greatest sages and
 leaders. Should you accomplish great achievements in your life, you can
 aspire to join the Court.</p><p>As a cleric or paladin of the Undying 
Court, you have a concrete relationship with your deity. In creating 
your character, consider why you've traveled so far from home. Are you 
on a specific mission? Are you serving the Court as a whole, or are you 
acting as an agent of a specific councilor—perhaps your own ancestor? 
The Undying Court despises undead creatures that prey on the living, so 
if you don't have a concrete mission, you can always hunt down undead

communion is a personal experience, the role of the priest is to provide

 the major themes of Eberron are manifest in the great city of Sharn. 
It's a place of magic, with skycoaches circling mile-high towers and 
mystic forges toiling endlessly in the bowels. It's a place of adventure
 and intrigue. A fallen angel is gathering minions in the ruins below 
the city. A gang war is gaining strength in Callestan. The corpse of a 
murdered aristocrat has just been discovered in a floating mansion. A 
Cannith artificer is experimenting with a planar gateway—and something 
is about to go terribly wrong. All of these adventures and a hundred 
more are waiting in the City of Towers.</p><p>This chapter details the city for players and DMs alike.

 is the largest city in Khorvaire, with a population of half a million 
people. Humans make up about a third of that number, and dwarves are a 
sixth of it; the rest is a blend of every race found across Khorvaire. 
Halflings, elves, and gnomes all have a significant presence in the 
city, but even kalashtar and changelings have communities in Sharn. 
Beyond the permanent population, tens of thousands of people pass 
through Sharn every day. Refugees from the war still find their way to 
the city, along with tourists, spies, merchants, and folk hoping to find
 their fortune in the grandest city in Eberron.</p><p>Sharn stands above
 the Dagger River and its eastern tributary, the Hilt. It's an important
 port for anyone dealing with Aerenal, Xen'drik, or Sarlona. Mountains 
line the shores of the Dagger, and Sharn can't spread out. So instead it
 has grown ever upward.</p><p>The city is primarily made up of these quarters:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Central Plateau</li><li class="rd__li ">Dura</li><li class="rd__li ">Menthis Plateau</li><li class="rd__li ">Northedge</li><li class="rd__li ">Tavick's Landing</li></ul><p>At
 the hub of each of these quarters is a cluster of enormous core towers.
 A web of bridges and platforms connects many of these vast spires, and 
smaller turrets sprout from the edges of the core towers. The district 
of Skyway floats above the highest towers, while the tunnels of the Cogs
 stretch out below the lower city.</p><p>In between those extremes, each
 of the quarters is divided into an upper ward, a middle ward, and a 
lower ward. Each ward is made up of a number of districts, so that the 
location of a place in Sharn can be expressed with a combination of a 
ward name and a district name. More information about each of the wards 
and the districts in them appears later in this chapter.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="620" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aftermath of War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p151</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Far
 from the front lines, Sharn never fell under siege during the Last War.
 Regardless, the war's impacts affected the city's citizens and continue
 to even today.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="621" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Physical Damage</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p151</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Although
 Sharn was never subjected to a sustained assault, it didn't avoid 
damage. On many occasions, commandos and saboteurs launched significant 
attacks inside Sharn. The most infamous of these was the Aundairian 
attack that brought down the floating Glass Tower, devastating the 
district now known as Fallen. In any of the lower or middle wards, you 
might encounter evidence of the conflict in the form of a shattered 
bridge, a building collapsed by an arcane explosion, or an area some say
 is haunted because of the large number of people killed there during 
the war.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="622" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Psychological Scars</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p151</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>There
 are places in the city that house people who suffered because of the 
actions of other nations. For example, many of the residents of Dura 
hold all Aundairians responsible for the destruction of Fallen. In 
another district, folk could hate the Karrns for an undead attack that 
occurred during the war, and a different group could blame Thrane for 
the siege of Vathirond. These kinds of sentiments can shape the feelings
 of an entire district, but in the city as a whole there are far more 
people who have personal burdens to carry than those who feel resentment
 toward particular nations. For instance, on an individual level, most 
members of the Sharn Watch might not care about a gnoll being seen in a 
neighborhood, but a guard who fought on the Droaam front during the war 
might be out for revenge. Warforged are sometimes also the targets of 
this sort of prejudice; a person whose friends were killed by warforged 
soldiers might resent all such creatures.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="623" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Shortages</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p152</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Because
 the ink is barely dry on the Treaty of Thronehold and relationships 
between the signatories are still being normalized, Sharn doesn't 
currently benefit from a lot of commerce with other nations. Problems 
could arise from a short supply of any imported goods, whether this 
manifests as inflated prices, the need for rationing, or certain items 
being simply unavailable. The factors of supply and demand also play 
into smuggling and the black market; some desirable goods might be 
available only through the Boromar Clan.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="624" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Refugees and Victims</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p152</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Cyran
 refugees have filled the district of High Walls in Lower Tavick's 
Landing beyond capacity, and Sharn is also home to a significant number 
of refugees from elsewhere in Breland—people whose homes and villages 
were destroyed during the war, and who have come to Sharn in search of 
new lives. The city also has its share of other people harmed during the
 war, soldiers and civilians with severe physical or psychological 
injuries. All these folk are most likely to be found in the lower wards.
 They aren't just poor; they're suffering—and they might seek vengeance 
against those they blame for their pain.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="625" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Guide to the City</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p152</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 incident isn't the first of its kind. Last month a clumsy warforged 
crushed two innocent halfling lovers. Before that, a shifter thief fell

affordable trinkets are all that stand between our safety and death 
caused by some rat who would rather spend gold on drink.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>As
 befits the City of Towers, Sharn is also a city of bridges and 
balconies. These thoroughfares and outcroppings can be extremely narrow 
or comfortably wide. Although most of them are bounded by walls or 
railings, there's always a chance that during your time in Sharn, you or
 someone you know will go over the edge. So, how do residents cope with 
this risk?</p><p>Those who can afford it usually carry a <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#feather%20token_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="feather%20token_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">feather token</a>

 spans connecting the towers, there's an excellent chance that you won't
 fall more than a hundred feet before impacting on a lower bridge.

 also used in this chapter as an indicator of what it costs for someone 
to live in a given area, and also of the costs of goods and services 
there.</p><p>For instance, a restaurant that is said to serve food of 
comfortable quality is one where a patron who lives a comfortable 
lifestyle (or better) can afford anything on the menu.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="633" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Education and Research</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p154</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Morgrave
 University, though not the most respectable institution of higher 
learning in Khorvaire, has an extensive library that boasts definitive 
collections of lore in certain fields, particularly arcana, 
dungeoneering, geography, and history. Characters seeking knowledge in 
any of these fields or others ought to be able to find resources in the 
library to aid their search. The university is an excellent source of 
sages who hire their services out on a short- or long-term basis. Even 
those who profess to be sages but have no connection to the university 
tend to cluster around Morgrave, with their homes and businesses almost 
all located in the University, Den'iyas, and Ivy Towers districts of 
Upper Menthis.</p><p>Another important site for certain kinds of 
research is the City Archive, in the Highest Towers district of Upper 
Central. The archive contains exhaustive historical documents of Sharn; 
birth, death, and marriage records; and copies of legal documents such 
as identification papers and letters of marque issued in the city. 
Access to these records, however, is more restricted than to the 
contents of the Morgrave library.</p><p>Those who want to further their 
research through some hands-on experience might find undiscovered lore 
in the lowest regions of Sharn, where sewers and tunnels snake through 
ancient ruins. Similarly, the crypts of the City of the Dead might hold 
some relevant historical information.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="634" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Shopping Centers</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p154</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Sharn
 contains a number of major shopping districts. The Tradefair district 
in Middle Central focuses on top-quality goods—everything you'll need to
 maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle. North Market in Lower 
Northedge has a fine selection of common goods. Almost anything can be 
found in the Bazaar of Middle Dura, as long as you're not concerned 
about the origin of secondhand goods. Tavick's Market in Middle Tavick's
 Landing is a center for produce and other goods brought in from the 
farms and artisan workshops outside Sharn.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="635" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Healing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p154</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>House
 Jorasco operates houses of healing throughout the city, largely in the

is the primary Jorasco enclave. The houses' services use the prices in 
this book's introduction.</p><p>The Panaceum has an altar that can be used to perform <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#raise%20dead_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="raise%20dead_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">raise dead</a>,
 but this service isn't without its risks. Sometimes the wrong spirit 
returns to a body, or malevolent ghosts or wraiths might escape from the
 netherworld along with the person being raised. Before the healers take
 gold to perform a resurrection, a Jorasco adept will first cast <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#augury_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="augury_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">augury</a>. If this divination indicates looming disaster, the adept will reject the request.</p><p>A
 few divine spellcasters in Sharn can raise the dead, notably the high 
priest of the Undying Court in Shae Lias. These devout clerics rarely 
sell their services, however, and the high priest would need a 
compelling reason to help someone who has different beliefs.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="636" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Holidays</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p154</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>There's
 always a celebration happening or about to happen in Sharn, whether 
it's a parade in a single district or a festival that ranges across the

 ir'Tains are the richest and most powerful family in Sharn. Each month,
 Lady Celyria ir'Tain holds a ball at her Skyway mansion. The guest list
 defines the current social order of the city; those families who hold 
permanent invitations, known as the Sixty, are the de facto royalty of 
Sharn. Celyria does invite unusual guests and attractions each month, 
and an up-and-coming entertainer or a renowned folk hero might catch her
 notice.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="638" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Crystalfall (9 Olarune)</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p154</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>During
 the Last War, saboteurs caused a floating tower to fall into Lower

 nation of Cyre was destroyed in 994 YK on this date, known as the Day 
of Mourning. Although that event had an impact on everyone in Khorvaire,
 this day of remembrance is especially significant to Cyran survivors. 
It is a time when Cyrans come together to recall their lost kingdom. 
Some tell stories or sing traditional songs, ensuring that their culture
 isn't forgotten. Other survivors still seethe with anger at the enemies
 who brought Cyre down, and thus far the holiday has been marked by a 
brief upturn in violence.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="640" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sun's Blessing (15 Therendor)</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p154</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The

can participate in the Hunt by making a donation of 5 gp; the hunter (or
 group) who brings down the beast wins a purse of 500 gp and the 
blessing of Balinor. The motif of the Hunt can vary; in some years, 
multiple beasts are released, and the hunter who catches the most of 
them is the victor. In any case, it often turns out that the other 
competitors are a greater threat to hunters than the beasts they stalk.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="645" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Fathen's Fall (25 Barrakas)</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p155</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>This

 the Fury, the god of Passion and Revenge, reaches the height of her

 are flying across Dura today, and the streets are full of color. Walk 
through Oldkeep wearing brown and red, and you'll be invited to raise a 
glass to the Griffon; if you're dressed in white and gold, the colors of
 the Hippogriff, you'd best be prepared to defend yourself.</p><p>If 
you're new to Sharn, you might think our city's gone mad. And in some 
ways it has, but it's a madness that reaches its peak every summer with 
the Race of Eight Winds. Long ago, King Galifar used Dura as a proving 
ground for aerial calvary. What's more important, quickness or strength?
 Our modern race is a test of speed and skill through a course that 
weaves around and through the spires of Dura. There are eight 
competitors, and each of these brave jockeys rides a different flying 
creature—except for the gargoyle Carralag, who relies on his own wings!</p><p>Speed
 is important, but merely surviving the race can be a challenge. The 
spilling of blood isn't prohibited, but the only weapon a rider can 
carry is a light sporting crossbow; the steeds can use their talons and 
beaks, which is what makes the Griffon such a fierce contender. Poison, 
magic, or anything else that would directly interfere with beast or 
rider is strictly forbidden—though over the years we've certainly seen 
imaginative attempts to stretch the rules!</p><p>Dura is divided into 
eight regions for the race, each of which is represented by a different 
creature. If you're going to spend time in Dura, it's best that you know
 your mounts! The beasts of Upper Dura are the fastest in the race, and 
overall have the best record. The reigning champion is the Pegasus of 
Highwater, whose supporters wear white and silver. The Hippogriff is 
tied to Overlook and Daggerwatch in Upper Dura, and its colors are white
 and gold. Detractors often say that the Sharn Watch favors the 
Hippogriff and that House Vadalis helps the Pegasus, but the referees 
always insist that the race is fair.</p><p>The beasts of Middle Dura are
 versatile. The Eagle represents Broken Arch and Stormhold in Middle 
Dura, and its supporters wear brown and gold. The clever Owl flies for 
Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. The Hawk 
represents Tumbledown and Underlook in Middle Dura, and wearing its 
blend of tan and brown can usually get you a good price at an inn.</p><p>The
 beasts of Lower Dura are more infamous than reliable. The Griffon flies
 for Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. It has 
never won the race, but there's gold to be made betting on which 
opponent it will bring down. The Glidewing represents Gate of Gold and 
The Stores, and its supporters wear green and gray; many believe that 
the Boromar Clan pays for the upkeep of the mount and its rider. 
Malleon's Gate used to be represented by the Bat, but twelve years ago 
they exchanged that mascot for the Gargoyle, whose colors are black and 
gray. The current <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#gargoyle_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="gargoyle_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Gargoyle</a> is a stone-faced fellow named Carralag, and his supporters are quite passionate about their winged champion.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>As
 befits a metropolis that boasts people of all cultures, Sharn hosts a 
wide variety of sports and athletic events. The Race of Eight Winds 
occurs once a year. Other events take place on a daily, weekly, or 
monthly schedule. For instance, shifters hold informal hrazhak 
competitions every night in Lower Northedge. The ogres of the Cogs are 
fond of tugs-of-war, arm wrestling, and similarly simple tests of 
strength. People who want to bet on sports can usually find a gambler 
willing to set odds in the Firelight district in Lower Menthis, 
Callestan in Lower Dura, Cornerstone in Middle Tavick's Landing, or 
Hareth's Folly in Middle Dura. Three exotic sports practiced in the city
 are described below.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="653" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Hrazhak</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p156</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Two
 teams of seven shifters play hrazhak on a field with a goal at each 
end. Each team starts out carrying a wooden idol. To score, a team must 
steal its opponent's idol and place both idols in its own goal. 
Obstacles such as trees, streams, and piles of rubble can be present on a
 hrazhak field, requiring the competitors to make full use of their 
jumping and climbing abilities. Idols can be thrown or carried, and 
there are no limits on contact between participants, although only 
natural weapons are allowed. Typically, a low-level druid or adept is on
 hand to provide healing if needed—but any competitor who receives aid 
is removed from play for the remainder of the match. Competitors aren't 
allowed to use spells or similar abilities.</p><p>The only formal 
hrazhak arena in Sharn is located in the Stone Trees, part of the 
Cornerstone district, where the matches serve as both a spectator sport 
and a reason for gambling. Shifters created temporary hrazhak fields in 
the slums and warehouse districts of the city from time to time, and 
shifter youths often play impromptu games in the parks.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="654" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Skyblades</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p156</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Common
 jousting is popular enough throughout Breland, but in Sharn, the sport 
has taken to the air. In a formal skyblades match, the goal is to knock 
an opposing rider from the saddle—attacks against mounts are forbidden, 
along with the use of magic or other supernatural abilities. Formal 
matches take place in one of Sharn's two aerial arenas, in Cornerstone 
and Hareth's Folly. Skyblades jousters typically ride <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#hippogriff_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="hippogriff_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">hippogriffs</a> and carry blunted lances that deal nonlethal damage.</p><p>Informal
 matches, which don't always use the same rules, occur from time to time
 in Lower and Middle Dura, Tavick's Landing, and Menthis Plateau. An 
informal match might be played out across an entire district, with 
competitors weaving between towers and around bridges. The rules for an 
informal match are set before the start, establishing (among other 
things) whether magic can be used and mounts can be targeted.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="655" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Six Stones</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p156</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 Droaam tradition brought to Sharn by immigrants, six stones is a game 
for seven competitors, who each pay a base stake. The seven are then 
sealed in a large chamber with a <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#cockatrice_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="cockatrice_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">cockatrice</a>.
 The match ends when six of the players have been turned to stone, at 
which point the survivor is awarded all the stakes (except for a share 
set aside for the organizers). A <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#medusa_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="medusa_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">medusa</a>
 handler monitors the competition to ensure that rules are followed. 
Contestants carry no arms or armor, and no magic or supernatural 
abilities may be used. Additionally, no one is allowed to attack the 
cockatrice. The challenge lies in outlasting the other contestants and 
luring them or pushing them into the path of the cockatrice. The 
battleground might be barren or littered with rubble and cover; it might
 be lit, or it could be be pitch black.</p><p>Six stones matches are staged by the criminal organization Daask (see the "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,8,criminal%20activities,0">Criminal Activities</a>"
 section later in this chapter). The sport is illegal, but the games go 
on because the matches are confined to Lower Dura and the Cogs and well 
hidden from the eyes of the Watch. A match usually occurs only once 
every few months. Sometimes participants voluntarily enter the 
competition, but most are debtors who have been offered a chance to pay 
off their loans by winning the match. Daask takes bets on the outcome, 
and usually earns a tidy sum as its share of the proceeds.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="656" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">City Government</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p156</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Sharn
 has many people in positions of power: beadles, ministers, bailiffs, 
and all manner of minor functionaries and officials. But ultimate power 
rests in the hands of the City Council. That body has seventeen members:
 one for each ward in the city, plus representatives from Skyway and the
 Cogs. Each ward has its own process for selecting a councilor, and 
there are no legal restrictions on who can govern; if you build up a 
strong base of support in a ward, you could hold the position yourself!</p><p>The
 members of the City Council are quite diverse. Some are crooked, others
 are idealists, and one of them appears to be an owl. All of them are 
well known in their home wards, and any of them could have use for a 
team of adventurers. The Sharn Councilors table describes a few of the 
city leaders you might bump into in Upper Central or at the Tain Gala.

 major religion has outposts in Sharn. A number of sacred sites draw 
pilgrims to the city from across Breland and Khorvaire. Priests don't 
usually sell their services; temples are places for worship and 
spiritual guidance.</p><p>The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of
 Breland, represented by shrines and small temples throughout the city. 
The Pavilion of the Host in Middle Central is the heart of the faith, 
and most priests of the Host live in one of the Pavilion's nine towers. 
Pilgrims often come to visit one of three particular sites. The 
Korranath in Upper Central features Khorvaire's largest temple of Kol 
Korran. The Great Hall of Aureon in Upper Menthis draws scholars and 
worshipers alike. The Pool of Onatar's Tears in the Blackbones district 
of the Cogs is said to impart a blessing to any smith who bathes their 
hands in its waters.</p><p>The Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame, Sharn's
 largest temple to the Silver Flame, is located in Upper Central. 
Archierophant Ythana Morr is frequently accused of corruption and 
nepotism, but there are smaller places of worship around the city 
devoted to the true principles of the faith. The hermit Gaia watches 
over the City of the Dead from Warden Tower. Coldflame Keep in Middle 
Northedge was once a mighty garrison; its glory has faded, but 
Flamebearer Mazin Tana still strives to protect his community. The 
priestess Faela maintains a small shrine in the shadows of Fallen, doing
 what she can to help the wretched people of that forsaken district. 
Finally, the Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is a sacred site in North 
Market, often visited by templars passing through the city.</p><p>Even 
some lesser known religions are represented in Sharn. The Graystone 
district in Middle Tavick's Landing is a haven for followers of the 
Blood of Vol. The Gates of Passage in Upper Northedge is a temple of the
 Undying Court. The Overlook district of Upper Dura holds the Shrine of 
il-Yannah, dedicated to the Path of Light.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="659" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Guilds and Groups</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p157</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Guilds
 and similar associations abound in Sharn. Their headquarters are places
 where people can find the company of fellow professionals, or perhaps 
enlist the assistance of an organization.</p><p>All the guilds 
associated with the dragonmarked houses are well represented in Sharn; 
most have guildhalls in the Dragon Towers district of Middle Central. 
Aside from those groups, the city features a number of less populous 
associations, such as those described below.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="660" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Adventurer's Guilds</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p157</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Sharn
 is a magnet for those who seek adventure and opportunity. Forgotten 
treasures are hidden in the ruins below the towers, and expeditions 
leave for Xen'drik every day. At any moment, dozens of sages, spies, and
 nobles around the city are searching for capable agents to help with 
their schemes and investigations. If you and your friends are searching 
for adventure, you've come to the right place, and you don't have to do 
it alone. Sharn is home to two organizations that provide adventurers 
with opportunities for work and camaraderie: the Clifftop Adventurer's 
Guild and the Deathsgate Guild.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="661" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Membership Benefits.</span></span> <p>Those
 who are accepted into either adventurer's guild must pay dues of 12 gp 
each year. The primary benefit of belonging to a guild is access to 
work, since the guildmaster can connect parties of adventurers with 
patrons and jobs suited to their talents. Beyond that, there are a few 
additional benefits:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">You can store items at the guildhall free of charge.</li><li class="rd__li ">You
 can book lodging at the guildhall for 5 sp per night. The 
accommodations are modest, but the guild provides stronger security for 
lodgers and their possessions than you'd find at an inn.</li><li class="rd__li ">An
 adventurer's guild is an excellent source of information. By studying 
records and working with other guild members, you can gain advantage on 
any skill check to research a subject in which the guild has expertise 
or experience.</li></ul><p>A strong rivalry exists between the 
Deathsgate Guild and the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. You might have 
trouble with members of the opposing guild, whether in the form of 
drunken boasting in a tavern or a rival stirring up trouble in the midst
 of a mission.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="662" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Clifftop Adventurer's Guild.</span></span> <p>Located
 in the Clifftop district of Upper Dura, this organization has a 
sterling reputation as a source of reliable explorers and champions. 
Clifftop adventurers are known for their courage and integrity, and 
guildmaster Summer Korranor holds members to a high standard of virtuous
 behavior. As a Clifftop adventurer, you're expected to keep your word, 
to stand by your comrades, to uphold the law, and never to intentionally
 endanger innocents with your actions. Many of the local businesses 
cater to adventurers, and if you're a member of the guild, you can 
expect a warm welcome in the taverns of Clifftop.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="663" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Deathsgate Guild.</span></span> <p>Adventurers
 who are willing to take on any job and to do whatever it takes to 
triumph might find themselves suited for membership in the Deathsgate 
Guild. Named for its proximity to the City of the Dead, the district of 
Deathsgate prides itself on being a haven for those who challenge death 
on a daily basis. The guild's founder, Kassh "Blackaxe" Droranath, 
doesn't care how his members do their jobs, as long as they don't fail.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="664" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Circle of Song</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p158</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 bard is a versatile individual, equally skilled at entertainment and 
espionage. These talents are perfectly matched to the city of Sharn, 
which is both the cultural heart of Breland and a nexus for intrigue and
 diplomacy. Bards have much to gain from the company of other bards, as 
they exchange news, stories, and songs. For this purpose, long ago a 
group of the finest bards in Sharn founded the Circle of Song, an 
alliance of entertainers and adventurers.</p><p>The Circle of Song is an
 informal organization, open to any bard who knows its customs and who 
can find an outpost. It has no membership dues; you're expected to make a
 donation if you make significant use of the group's resources. 
Membership provides the following benefits:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">You
 can always find food and lodging at a circle outpost, though you might 
be expected to entertain the patrons in exchange. If times are tough, 
your food and lodging might be a step lower than the usual quality of 
the inn, but at least it's free.</li><li class="rd__li ">You have 
advantage on ability checks made to perform research or gather 
information while in a circle outpost, provided you have an opportunity 
to peruse archives and talk with other members.</li><li class="rd__li ">Circle
 members are often willing to do minor favors for other 
members—gathering information, embarrassing a minor noble, causing a 
distraction. There's no cost for such a service, but anyone who helps 
you will expect you to provide similar assistance when they need it.</li></ul><p>The
 first and oldest outpost of the Circle of Song is the Golden Horn in 
the University district of Upper Menthis; a few bards are almost always 
in residence and willing to share news and stories. Other, less 
elaborate outposts are maintained in Sharn, and over the centuries the 
circle has established outposts in most major cities and many smaller 
communities across Khorvaire. These sites are usually taverns or inns 
that have hidden areas accessible only to members of the circle.</p><p>Bards
 are expected to set aside personal rivalries while in a circle outpost,
 and any kind of combat or violence is prohibited. Violating this rule 
results in immediate expulsion from the circle, at the least.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="665" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Arcane Orders</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p158</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Its
 mighty towers and floating spires mark Sharn as a symbol of mystic 
power and achievement. Soon after the founding of the city, the greatest
 wizards of Breland chose it to be the seat of their arcane order. Its 
goal was to celebrate excellence in the mystic arts, bringing together 
the greatest practitioners of magic in a society that rivals Arcanix and
 the institutions of Aundair.</p><p>A schism split the original society,
 but today both of the branches of the original organization, the 
Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, are 
recognized and respected throughout Breland. Each one has lesser halls 
in every major city in the nation.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="666" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Membership Benefits.</span></span> <p>Someone
 accepted into an arcane order must pay 1,000 gp to join, with ongoing 
dues of 250 gp each year thereafter. With this payment comes many 
benefits, including the following:</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">You can stay at the order's hall in any major city and enjoy the amenities of a wealthy lifestyle free of charge.</li><li class="rd__li ">For as long as you have access to the order's hall, the cost of crafting a magic item at the site is reduced by 10 percent.</li><li class="rd__li ">While in the hall, you have advantage on Intelligence (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="arcana_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Arcana</span>) checks, as well as any ability checks involving arcane research.</li><li class="rd__li ">Membership
 in an arcane order grants prestige within Breland. Though this status 
provides no tangible benefit, it proves that you are a gifted mage and 
stand above any mere magewright or dabbler.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="667" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Esoteric Order of Aureon.</span></span> <p>Members
 of the larger of the two societies, the Esoteric Order of Aureon, take a
 vow to use their talents to preserve and advance civilization and to 
operate within the confines of the law. The Esoteric Order helped 
Galifar I maintain the rule of law, and many of its members served 
Breland during the Last War. Although its members aren't prohibited from
 studying any form of magic, the specialties of the order are 
abjuration, divination, and evocation magic. Wizards and artificers are 
almost always welcome in the guild. Sorcerers must prove their grasp of 
arcane theory to earn a place, and warlocks are rarely accepted as 
members. The hall of the Esoteric Order of Aureon is in the district of 
Clifftop in Upper Dura.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="668" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Guild of Starlight and Shadows.</span></span> <p>Breland's
 other arcane order encourages independence and innovation, qualities 
that contribute to a mutually uncomfortable relationship between the 
Guild of Starlight and Shadows and the Sharn Watch. The schools of 
conjuration, enchantment, and illusion are favored by this group. 
Warlocks, especially those of the Archfey, are generally welcome. 
Members of the Esoteric Order look down on Starlight wizards, and in 
turn the guild members often mock the wizards of the Esoteric Order and 
play pranks on them. The Guild of Starlight and Shadows has its hall in 
the Deathsgate district in Middle Tavick's Landing.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="669" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Closed Circle.</span></span> <p>There
 is one dark stain in the shared history of the arcane orders. Three 
hundred years ago, a third order arose in Sharn—a sinister cabal called 
the Closed Circle. This order specialized in transmutation and 
necromancy and dabbled in the forbidden lore of the daelkyr and the 
Dragon Below. It's said that the members of the Closed Circle went mad 
and sought to summon terrible things; whatever the truth, the guild was 
wiped out more than two hundred years ago by the combined action of the 
Church of the Silver Flame, the Esoteric Order, and the Guild of 
Starlight and Shadows. Hidden workshops of the Closed Circle might still
 be found in Sharn, where vengeful liches or other wizards of the Circle
 practice their dark arts in hiding.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 is a vertical city, and elevation is an indicator of status and wealth.
 Each quarter is roughly divided into three levels, and the combination 
of quarter and level defines a ward. Thus, wards have names such as 
Lower Dura, Upper Central, and Middle Menthis.</p><p>Upper wards are the
 domain of the rich and powerful. Here you'll find the finest goods and 
the most expensive services. Only those who maintain a wealthy or 
aristocratic lifestyle can easily afford the prices for meals and 
lodging, and adventurers who maintain a squalid or wretched lifestyle 
might be treated with disdain (suffering disadvantage on Charisma 
checks).</p><p>Violence is rare in any of the upper wards, and the Sharn
 Watch actively patrols these areas. Although the guards here might be 
corrupt just as in a middle or lower ward, they're already being well 
paid by powerful nobles and criminal organizations, and they work 
efficiently in the service of these forces.</p><p>Middle wards are home 
to the middle classes. Here you'll find bustling markets and taverns, 
along with a wide range of entertainment and housing. Most goods and 
services are affordable by those of a modest or comfortable lifestyle, 
with a few higher-priced options tucked away. The Sharn Watch has a 
presence, but not as strong as in the upper wards.</p><p>Lower wards 
house the hard-working laborers, along with the destitute and the 
desperate, including refugees who lost everything in the war and orphans
 who never had anything to begin with. Services priced for a modest 
lifestyle can be found, but overall the lower wards are home to those 
who have no better than a poor lifestyle; a visitor who displays signs 
of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle might attract unwanted attention.
 The watch pays little attention to the lower districts, making them a 
haven for criminals and gangs.</p><p>These are stereotypes that don't 
apply to all wards. Dura is a particularly poor quarter, meaning that 
Upper Dura is effectively a middle ward in economic terms; similarly, 
because Central Plateau is a hub of wealth and power, Lower Central is 
effectively a middle ward.</p><p>Each ward is further subdivided into 
districts, which are neighborhoods defined by an economic role, a 
separate culture, or both. For example, Lower Northedge includes the 
districts of Stoneyard, Longstairs, and North Market. It's generally 
true that the combination of a district's ward and quarter will give you
 a broad idea of what to expect there. A district in Upper Central will 
typically be well kept and swarming with guards, while a district in 
Lower Dura will be squalid and dangerous.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 is an enormous city, and traveling on foot from one side of the city to
 the other can be time-consuming. Here are some travel-time guidelines:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">It takes at least 30 minutes to cross a ward.</li><li class="rd__li ">If you're traveling between wards, add 30 minutes for each ward you pass through.</li><li class="rd__li ">Dura and Tavick's Landing are especially large; double the time it takes to move through one of them.</li></ul><p>For
 instance, traveling from Lower Menthis to Upper Central involves 
passing through three wards (taking a bridge from Lower Menthis to Lower
 Central, then ascending two levels) and can take 90 minutes or longer.</p><p>Not all the quarters are linked to one another by bridges. The connections that do exist include these:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Central Plateau has bridges that lead to Northedge and Menthis.</li><li class="rd__li ">Dura is connected to Tavick's Landing and Menthis.</li><li class="rd__li ">Tavick's Landing is connected to Dura, Menthis, and Northedge.</li><li class="rd__li ">Menthis is connected to Tavick's Landing, Dura, and Central.</li><li class="rd__li ">Northedge is connected to Central and Tavick's Landing.</li></ul><p>Traveling
 from district to district involves the use of bridges and ramps, along 
with magic lifts—vast floating disks that slowly ascend and descend 
along threads of mystical energy. Lifts are mainly used to move cargo 
and can be up to 30 feet in diameter. Most lifts have rails but aren't 
fully enclosed; if combatants fight on a lift, someone falling or being 
pushed off the edge is always a possibility.</p><p>For a speedier 
journey through the streets, House Orien manages a system of carriages 
for hire. Taking an Orien carriage cuts travel time in half and costs 2 
cp per ward traveled. Flight is, of course, the fastest way to get 
around in Sharn, cutting travel time down to one-sixth of the walking

Portrait of The ir'Tains and the 60 Families</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p165</span></span><p>If you've read more than two issues of the <i>Sharn Inquisitive</i>,
 you've seen at least two stories about the ir'Tain family. King Boranel
 might rule Breland, and the Lord Mayor might be our highest appointed 
official, but the ir'Tains are the true royalty of our city. What 
citizen of Sharn doesn't have an opinion about the fate of Lord Dalian 
ir'Tain, lost at sea a decade ago? Many are sure that he's a prisoner of
 the sahuagin, which would explain why Lady Celyria has been funding 
expeditions into the sahuagin realms. Another camp maintains that Lord 
Dalian staged his death so he could embrace a swashbuckling life as a 
pirate king. If the truth ever comes out, you can be sure you'll read 
about it here!</p><p>Matriarch Lady Celyria ir'Tain is the queen of high
 society in Sharn. Her activities and those of the ir'Tain children 
account for just as much newsprint as their father used to. Dalian's 
eldest son, Dalas ir'Tain, shocked society last week when he publicly 
denounced the Brelish monarchy. The dalliances of younger siblings Cyra 
and Daral sell more issues of the <i>Inquisitive</i> whenever such are 
reported, and the wedding of middle sister Cariana ir'Tain and Mayne 
Jhaelian of Aerenal will surely be the biggest social event of 998 YK.</p><p>The
 ir'Tain fortune is tied to the City of Towers. Tain gold funded the 
construction of many of the towers of Sharn, and the family owns vast 
sections of the city. You've likely heard of the Sixty Families of 
Sharn, considered the guiding lights of the city. Most assume that these
 luminaries are ancient and established, their status tied to a royal 
decree. In fact, when the Tains built their mansion on Skyway, they 
ordered the architects to design a banquet hall that would seat sixty 
families and their servants. The original Sixty Families were those that

never been restored. Dura is riddled with poverty and crime; it's easily
 the most dangerous section of the city. But it also holds opportunities

modest or comfortable lifestyle. The merchants and artisans are 
accustomed to dealing with unusual individuals, and adventurers receive a
 warm welcome here.</p><p>Clifftop is a home away from home for

 Highwater district is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of Dura and is
 the site of Pegasus Spire, the enclave of House Vadalis. The temple 
district of Hope's Peak features the Citadel of Light, a grand temple of

 in Middle Dura, the district of Hareth's Folly is a bizarre blend of 
architectural styles. One of the primary attractions is the Hollow 
Tower, an enormous arena that features aerial jousting and racing. The 
King of Fire is a grand tavern that hosts a broad range of gambling and 
bookmaking activities, legal and otherwise.</p><p>Many people make their
 homes in Middle Dura, even if their jobs take them elsewhere. 
Rattlestone and Tumbledown are mostly poor tenements. Stormhold contains
 crumbling manors still occupied by some of Sharn's oldest families, 
while many that have prospered have moved on to more prestigious

 aptly named Precarious district in Lower Dura leans out over the edge 
of the cliffs, and the Skydocks—a system using gigantic arcane cranes 
and levitation—carry material up from Cliffside and the docks. 
Precarious is also filled with warehouses that hold these goods. Because
 Precarious plays an important role in the economy of the city, it's the
 only district in Lower Dura where the Sharn Watch maintains a 
significant presence.</p><p>The rest of Lower Dura, in stark contrast, 
has been left to rot. Ignored by the Watch, it is the domain of gangs 
and crime lords. The inhabitants of the ward are often protected from 
violence by their criminal connections or by virtue of having nothing 
worth stealing, but adventurers ought to tread lightly here, especially 
those who display the trappings of a wealthy lifestyle.</p><p>There was a
 time when Lower Dura was the heart of Sharn, and remnants of this glory
 remain. The Silvermist Theater in Callestan was built to entertain 
nobles. The ward boasted manors, temples, and a garrison for the watch. 
But all of these edifices were abandoned long ago, and now most are home
 to nothing but squatters and vermin.</p><p>The district of Callestan is
 a nexus of sorts, where all the major criminal powers of Sharn have a 
stake. Those groups are described in more detail later in this chapter.</p><p>The
 district of Fallen is a haunted ruin; this temple district was 
abandoned after it was struck by a falling tower. It's covered in more 
detail later in this chapter.</p><p>Malleon's Gate is home to the 
goblins of Sharn, along with other monstrous immigrants from Droaam and 
Darguun. The district can be an especially dangerous place for halflings
 or anyone tied to the Boromar Clan.</p><p>Oldkeep and Gate of Gold are 
wretched tenement districts. A significant halfling community lives in 
the district known as The Stores, which is also a stronghold for the 
Boromar Clan.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="692" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Things to Do in Dura</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p169</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Dura
 is a quarter of extremes, from the nearly idyllic atmosphere of Upper

diversions are these:</p><p><b>Gamble</b>. Legal gambling is heavily 
taxed in the city and limited in its scope. Dura is the place to find a 
wide range of shadier and more profitable games.</p><p><b>Go shopping</b>.
 The Bazaar of Middle Dura is an excellent source for exotic goods, 
legal or otherwise. Clifftop, in Upper Dura, caters to adventurers and 
has a reasonable selection of magical goods.</p><p><b>Bend the law</b>. Looking for a fence or need to hire an assassin? Lower Dura is the nexus for criminal activities in Sharn.</p><p><b>Talk about the race.</b> The inhabitants of Dura are devoted to the Race of Eight Winds and are always willing to discuss the latest news.</p><p><b>Suffer a terrible accident.</b>
 The Sharn Watch ignores much of Lower Dura. Stories circulate 
continuously about dragonmarked houses and mad wizards conducting 
dangerous experiments in Lower Dura without interference from the law.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="693" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Menthis Plateau</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p169</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 Menthis boasts the most diverse population of any ward in Sharn. The 
Little Plains district is the destination for halfling immigrants from 
the Talenta Plains. Cassan Bridge has a significant population of orcs 
and half-orcs from the Shadow Marches. Immigrants from the Lhazaar 
Principalities have settled in the Warden Towers district, which is 
primarily a garrison for the Sharn Watch. The district of Smoky Towers 
had a significant Cyran community even before the Last War; now, this 
area has become a haven for Cyrans wealthy enough to escape the refugee 
camps of High Walls.</p><p>One of the most prominent attractions In 
Smoky Towers is the Classic Theater. The place lives up to its name by 
staging only traditional works written before the start of the Last War.
 Although the Grand Stage in the University district also performs more 
recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated 
policy of not even considering new works.</p><p>The Everbright district 
might be of particular interest to adventurers. A wide assortment of 
magewrights ply their trade here, and the shops have a good selection of
 magic items (of common and uncommon rarity). The people of Middle 
Menthis are law-abiding folk; visitors looking for spellcasters to help 
with illegal activities or who want to sell stolen artifacts will likely
 have better luck in Lower Dura.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="697" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lower Menthis</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p170</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Providing

 list of attractions that tries to summarize what Menthis Plateau has to
 offer, even without considering all the performance events, is doomed 
to be incomplete. Of the countless possibilities, some of the most 
popular reasons to come here are the following:</p><p><b>Consult a sage</b>.
 Morgrave University might not be the finest institute of learning in 
Khorvaire, but it's the best Sharn has to offer. Whether you want to 
conduct your own research in the library or find a specialist in goblin 
history, Morgrave likely has what you need.</p><p><b>Go into show business.</b>
 Menthis has a wide range of performance venues, from the Grand Stage to
 the many taverns of Lower Menthis. In addition to enjoying the 
entertainment, you could try to find work—either showcasing your 
artistic talents on stage or displaying another sort of prowess in the 
Burning Ring.</p><p><b>Join an expedition</b>. Scholars at Morgrave 
often sponsor expeditions to Xen'drik and into the ruins below Sharn. 
Cyran nobles in Smoky Towers sometimes hire brave souls to venture into 
the Mournland to reclaim lost treasures.</p><p><b>See other cultures</b>.
 Den'iyas brings a touch of Zilargo to Sharn. You might find a clawfoot 
raptor running down the streets in Little Plains, or a Gatekeeper druid 
casting bones on Cassan Bridge.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="701" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Northedge</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p171</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Northedge residential area is the quietest quarter of Sharn. At first

 with dry eyes. I believe that even a warforged would be moved to tears 
by this unflinching look at the spiritual cost of war. It's brutal, 
painful, and true—which is why it was all the more shocking when it 
first opened at the Diamond Theater. The Downstairs district of Lower 
Menthis is mainly known for its bawdy entertainment and base comedy, not
 cutting-edge political commentary. Thus, we critics assumed that this 
dramatic work was a singular event, until a new play titled <i>Fallen Angels</i>
 exceeded our every expectation. Month after month in recent times, the 
Diamond has struck us to the quick with emotional works about the Last 
War and the psychic wounds we're still struggling with.</p><p>Who is the
 playwright of the Diamond Theater responsible for these stirring 
stories? Her name is Luca Syara, but beyond that, she's an enigma. 
There's no such person on the rolls of the bardic colleges of Breland, 
and House Phiarlan and House Thuranni claim to know nothing about her. 
Syara shuns the spotlight and refuses all interviews. While her works 
are being debated and celebrated in classrooms and taverns, the artist 
spends her days in the dingy back rooms of the Diamond Theater. This 
seclusion has led to a number of fanciful rumors. Some say Syara fought 
in the Last War and that she was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning. A 
wilder rumor maintains that she is an exile from the Faerie Court of 
Thelanis, an archfey bound to human form.</p><p>While we wait for answers to this mystery, we encourage you to sample Syara's latest work. <i>Five Lives</i>
 is a gutwrenching tragedy that forces us to look at our darkest hours, 
and to consider the suffering of our enemies and the common threads that
 unite us all. If you're looking to forget your troubles, by all means, 
go see <i>Facade</i> or <i>The Late Count</i>. But if you want to take in a performance that might make you a better person, do whatever it takes to get tickets to <i>Five Lives</i>.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>Upper
 Northedge is the perfect place for the noble who can afford a manor in 
the clouds but wants to avoid the bustle of Upper Central. The districts
 of Crystal Bridge and Oak Towers are filled with spire-topped manors 
and grand estates. A host of rooftop parks and gardens provide lovely 
spaces to sit and reflect.</p><p>Shae Lias is arguably the most 
remarkable district of Upper Northedge. Its population is largely 
composed of elves, and it is a bastion of Aereni culture and traditions.
 The heart of Shae Lias is the Gates of Passage, a grand structure that 
is both the Aereni embassy and a temple to the Undying Court. The 
priests of the Undying Court don't share this information with 
outsiders, but many residents believe that an actual member of the 
Court—an ancient undead elf possessing vast knowledge and divine 
power—resides in the temple.</p><p>Other points of interest in Shae Lias
 include the Oaks, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, which serves 
food of the highest quality (and priced accordingly). The Veil of Flesh 
specializes in Aereni body art, in the form of both traditional tattoos 
and temporary illusions woven directly into the skin. The business known
 as Nightshade might be the most unusual watering hole in Sharn, 
doubling as apothecary and tavern; the house specialty is beverages 
tainted with weak poisons, designed to take the imbiber to the very edge
 of death.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="705" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Middle Northedge</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p171</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>This
 ward caters to the middle class of Sharn, offering a wide range of 
comfortable housing. Dwarves make up most of the population, with the 
highest concentration in the district of Holdfast. In contrast to the 
residents of Highhold in Upper Dura, the dwarves of Holdfast have deep 
roots in Sharn and feel no strong connection to the Mror Holds or its 
traditions.</p><p>High Hope is a temple district; although the city's 
most impressive churches and shrines are located in Upper Central, it's 
commonly known that if you're looking for a truly devoted priest, you 
should go to High Hope. The most notable feature of the district is 
Daca's Watch. Twelve feet high, this pillar is thought to have once held
 a statue or monument. Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed 
atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice 
to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn't claim to be a priest, the
 people of the community say that she's blessed by the god Boldrei and 
speaks with the Sovereign's voice. True or not, Daca's advice has proven
 to be remarkably sound, and she and her pillar have become a tourist 
attraction.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="706" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lower Northedge</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p171</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Although
 it's poverty-stricken, Lower Northedge is a significant step up from 
the slums of Lower Dura. The people of Lower Northedge don't look for 
trouble, and they don't like it coming to their doorstep. North Market 
is one of the largest markets in Sharn, though in contrast to the Bazaar
 of Dura it mostly offers simple, everyday goods.</p><p>Lower Northedge 
has a significant shifter population. The Rat's Nest is a tavern that 
caters to shifters, and the Bear's Rest is an inn run by a family of 
shifters. Tooth &amp; Nail is an apothecary specializing in the care of 
fangs and claws. Particularly in the districts of North Market and 
Stoneyard, shifter children play hrazhak in the streets; this flamboyant
 sport involves making dramatic leaps and scaling walls.</p><p>The 
Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is an infamous spot in North Market. It is 
dedicated to a crusading priest of the Silver Flame who uncovered a 
group of wererats in the early days of Sharn. Fathen was torn apart by 
the wererats he had exposed, and in his honor the Church of the Silver 
Flame raised the shrine on this site. It's said that any lycanthrope 
that enters the shrine will be forced into its true form. Pilgrims 
devoted to the Silver Flame come from across Khorvaire to pray at the 
shrine, but the local shifter population has no love for the pilgrims or
 the church.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="707" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Things to Do in Northedge</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p172</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Northedge
 is the most peaceful quarter in Sharn. It does have a few taverns and 
temples, but if you're looking for excitement or a wide selection of 
goods and services, you'll want to go elsewhere. Even so, Northedge 
boasts some notable special attractions:</p><p><b>Settle down</b>. If 
you're looking for a place to live in Sharn, Lower Northedge residences 
are of reasonable quality and price and offer more security than Lower 
Dura.</p><p><b>Die in style</b>. The elves of Shae Lias are experts in 
funerary customs and embalming. In addition, the high priest of the 
Gates of Passage is capable of raising the dead.</p><p><b>Find a patron</b>.
 Many eccentric nobles make their homes in Upper Northedge. A patron of 
the arts could take an interest in the career of a bard or an 
entertainer. A collector might keep capable adventurers on retainer with
 the understanding that they'll deliver any Dhakaani artifacts they come
 across in their travels. You never know what benefits a patron will 
provide; at the very least, having a patron can provide you with an 
introduction to high society.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="708" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tavick's Landing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p172</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Everyone
 who comes to Sharn, whether by land or air, passes through Tavick's

the tense atmosphere can still be felt today. On the positive side, 
Watch Commander Iyanna ir'Talan has gone to great efforts to purge 
corruption in the local garrisons of the Sharn Watch; as a result, this 
is one of the few districts where the Watch is both helpful and 
competent. On the downside, visitors from any nation that fought against
 Breland during the war might be greeted with suspicion or hostility.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="709">Tavick's Landing: Noteworthy Locations</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2" data-rd-isroller="false">Location</th><th class="col-8" data-rd-isroller="false">Description</th><th class="col-2" data-rd-isroller="false">District</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="col-2">Crystals of Denion</td><td class="col-8">This

 ward is effectively a self-contained city catering to the nobles that 
live there. It has fine housing, skilled services, a luxurious 
mercantile district, and even an entire district—Sunrise—designed for 
the servants of the nobles. The services and lodging in Sunrise 
accommodate those with poor or modest lifestyles, as opposed to the 
higher-priced goods found elsewhere in the ward.</p><p>For those willing
 to put up with its restrictive laws, Upper Tavick's Landing has many 
fine features. Wyredd's Spirits is the best source for wine in Sharn. 
The shop Crystals of Denion buys and sells rare magic items, though it 
only has a handful of such items at any given time. Transmutation is a 
renowned beauty salon providing both mundane and arcane services. House 
Deneith maintains a fortified garrison and training facility in the 
Copper Arch district.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="711" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Laws of Upper Tavick's Landing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p173</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>During
 the war, fears of attacks by foreign agents resulted in the 
establishment of a number of laws here that affect visitors, including 
adventurers, to this day.</p><p>The soldiers of House Deneith have full 
authority to act as agents of the Sharn Watch in Upper Tavick's Landing,
 and staff of Deneith's elite Blademark mercenaries maintain checkpoints
 at the district's edges.</p><p>You need a license to carry a weapon in 
Upper Tavick's Landing. It costs only 5 gp, but you have to plead your 
case to a clerk. Any Blademark or member of the watch can demand to see 
your license and might confiscate unauthorized weapons. You also need a 
license to cast spells in the ward. It costs 10 gp, and you must specify
 the spells you intend to cast. A fine can be levied for any 
unauthorized use of magic. To get licenses for weapons or spellcasting, 
you'll have to go to the courthouse in the Twelve Pillars district.</p><p>Another
 law requires inhabitants to dress "in a manner that upholds the solemn 
dignity of this proud ward." Blademarks and officers of the watch can 
choose how they interpret this. Typically, armor is considered 
inappropriate unless you're tied to House Deneith or the Sharn Watch, or
 you've served with the Brelish military. Anyone in contempt of this law
 is escorted out.</p><p>Any sort of unruly behavior—fighting, shouting 
in the streets, and the like—brings a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary 
expulsion from the ward.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="712" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Middle Tavick's Landing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p173</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Unlike
 the upper ward, Middle Tavick's Landing welcomes travelers and 
tourists. The ward features a host of lively taverns and excellent inns.
 The Cornerstone is a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses
 to aerial jousting. The Deathsgate district caters to adventurers, much
 as the Clifftop district of Upper Dura does. Like Clifftop, the 
district has an adventurer's guild—though the Deathsgate Guild has a 
dark reputation, and its members often pick fights with Clifftop 
adventurers. (See the "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,8,adventurer's%20guilds,0">Adventurer's Guilds</a>"
 section for more information.) House Jorasco has a large house of 
healing in the ward, and House Deneith maintains a recruiting station 
for would-be mercenaries.</p><p>The Graystone district has deep roots in
 Karrnathi culture that predate the Last War; Slogar's and the Bloody 
Mug are places where homesick Karrns can enjoy blood sausage and 
Nightwood ale. The district is a haven for Karrnathi soldiers who want 
to avoid Brelish aggression and a place where followers of the Blood of 
Vol can practice their faith.</p><p>Tavick's Market is one of Sharn's 
major market districts; located directly above the Terminus lightning 
rail station, it's filled with stands selling produce and goods brought 
in by local farmers.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="713">

 land routes to Sharn both end at Lower Tavick's Landing. The Orien 
lightning rail deposits passengers in the district of Terminus, while 
those who travel to Sharn on the Old Road arrive at Wroann's Gate. 
Getting to the better parts of Sharn from here means passing through 
Black Arch, a heavily fortified garrison district designed to repel 
enemies and withstand a full siege. The ward offers a variety of 
services catering to travelers; the Dragoneyes district is a maze of 
taverns, inns, brothels, and gambling halls. Dragoneyes is also 
noteworthy for being the site of one of the few changeling communities 
in Breland.</p><p>House Orien has a strong presence in Lower Tavick's 
Landing, and Orien heirs, laborers, and teamsters can be found in many 
of the districts. House Lyrandar and House Deneith are also well 
represented, with their representatives arranging matters of trade, 
transport, and security.</p><p>These days, Lower Tavick's Landing is 
best known for High Walls, a former residential district converted into a
 home for refugees from the Last War. High Walls is filled past 
capacity, mostly by Cyrans who were displaced by the Mourning. The gates
 are open at present, but High Walls is designed to serve as a fortress 
prison if the need arises, and the Sharn Watch keeps an eye out for any 
signs of unrest.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="715" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Things to Do in Tavick's Landing</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p175</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="716" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Voice of Breland—is your Neighbor a cyran invader?</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p175</span></span><p>In
 the wake of the Mourning, our king welcomed the survivors of that 
tragedy into our cities. In Sharn, High Walls alone holds more Cyran 
refugees than Karrnath has allowed across its borders. If you read the 
Sharn Inquisitive or the Korranberg Chronicle, you've heard the endless 
litany of how difficult life is, tales of overcrowding, starvation, and 
disease. Although we at the Voice of Breland sympathize with all who 
suffer, we refuse to ignore the deadly threat in our midst. The majority
 of Cyrans who survived the Mourning did so because they were beyond the
 borders of their nation. And why is that? Because they were soldiers.</p><p>The
 Sharn Inquisitive talks about starving children and ailing peasants, 
but it doesn't mention the Cyran special forces and elite war mages who 
now reside in High Walls. As Brelish, we all want to show compassion to 
the truly innocent, but let us never forget that these people were once 
our enemy and could be again. And let us also remember that the cause of
 the Mourning remains a mystery. Was it divine punishment for Cyran sins
 that have yet to be washed clean? Or could it have been a premature 
activation of an arcane weapon—and if so, could Cyran artificers already
 be working on an improved version in the heart of our greatest city?</p><p>Remain alert, people of Breland! Don't let the current plight of these unfortunates blind you to the danger!</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>As
 a metropolitan district filled with immigrants, merchants, and 
travelers from across Khorvaire and beyond it, Tavick's Landing offers a
 host of opportunities to enjoy food and entertainment from distant 
lands. Or you might find yourself here for one of a few specific 
reasons, such as:</p><p><b>Take a chance</b>. The Dragoneyes district is
 filled with ways to lose your wages, both in established gambling halls
 and on street corners. If you you're looking for something a little 
more exotic, see if you can find Chance. This is the name both of a 
secret, roaming gambling den and of the changeling who runs it. In 
addition to offering all manner of mundane games and bets, Chance is 
said to be able to arrange and cover nearly any sort of wager or duel. 
Are you ready to gamble with a fiend? Would you wager a year of your 
life for a moment of good fortune when you need it the most? If any of 
the rumors are true, these are examples of what's possible at Chance.</p><p><b>Find refuge</b>.
 Though most of the refugees in High Walls come from Cyre, the district 
is a haven for anyone displaced in the war, including Brelish. The place
 is overcrowded, however, and resources are stretched thin. Tensions are
 high, and feuds and power struggles among the refugees take place 
regularly. If you're from Cyre, you might be able to find a cot in High 
Walls, especially if you already have friends or family living there.</p><p><b>Bond over blood</b>.
 The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is one of the few 
places in Breland where the Blood of Vol religion is practiced openly. 
Residents are circumspect about their activities, and undead servants 
are largely kept off the streets. But if you're a follower of the faith,
 it's a place where you can participate in the Sacrament of the Blood or
 consult with a priest. It's also the best place to find a skilled 
necromancer, or to hear rumors about the latest schemes of the Order of 
the Emerald Claw.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="717" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Above and Below</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p175</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

		</div></div><p></p><p>A number of floating towers drift above the 
upper wards of Sharn, but these are dwarfed by Skyway, an entire 
district suspended above and between Central Plateau and Menthis 
Plateau. Built on an island of solidified cloud, Skyway holds the 
mansions of the wealthiest people in Khorvaire—nobles whose feet never 
touch the ground. It's a realm of wonders, filled with the finest 
examples of luxury and extravagance that gold can buy and magic can 
produce. For instance, Cloudpool Park is formed from sculpted 
cloudstuff, with window panels of ice that provide a view of the city 
below.</p><p>Skyway is home to lavish estates. Prior to the Last War, 
noble families from across the Five Nations maintained mansions here. 
Though some of these places remain in the hands of their original 
owners, others were seized by the crown during the Last War and sold to 
wealthy citizens of Breland. The resulting influx of residents has 
brought more diversity to the district, with dragonmarked heirs and even
 wealthy criminals living alongside the nobility. The grandest estate in
 Skyway is Tain Manor, home of the ir'Tain family and the monthly Tain 
Gala (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,8,holidays,0">Holidays</a>" earlier in this chapter).</p><p>This
 district offers the highest-priced services in the city. The Dragon's 
Hoard is a Ghallanda resort, where travelers can enjoy the utmost in 
luxury if they can afford the most expensive amenities. The Celestial 
Vista and the Cloud Dragon are wondrous restaurants. The Azure Gateway 
is a new hotel and restaurant that has replaced a Ghallanda 
establishment. The owner has remained anonymous, and this touch of 
mystery has piqued interest in the place.</p><p>If you're interested in 
mingling with nobles or celebrities, or if you want to pull off a heist 
that targets the richest people in Sharn, Skyway is the place to do 
that.</p><p>No bridges or lifts connect Skyway to the rest of the city, 
so the usual way to reach the floating district is by taking a skycoach 
or hiring a flying mount.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="720" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cliffside</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p176</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Cliffside
 encompasses the docks and waterfront of Sharn, running along the edge 
of the Dagger River and up the cliff above it. Massive lifts levitate 
goods up to the skydocks in the district of Precarious. The area's rough
 and poor, filled with sailors and dockworkers. Many of these boisterous
 folk love the life in Cliffside; as a common saying goes, "Better a 
tankard of ale in Cliffside than a barrel of Central wine."</p><p>Plenty
 of legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and 
repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need to hire crew, and 
sailors need a dry bed to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses 
meet different kinds of demands. These services include bordellos, 
taverns, gaming dens, and shadier entertainments for sailors to spend 
their off duty hours and wages on.</p><p>Even though the Sharn Watch has
 a token presence here, Cliffside remains one of the most crime-ridden 
districts in the city. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of 
sahuagin, who sell their services as guides to help ships traveling to 
Xen'drik. In fact, the sahuagin rarely initiate violence, but there have
 been clashes between them and aggressive, drunken sailors.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="721" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Cogs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p176</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Cogs lie deep beneath Sharn, below the sewers and Old Sharn (described 
later in this chapter). Streams of Fernian lava flow through this area, 
and over the centuries, House Cannith has helped Breland establish vast 
foundries that tap this mystic resource. Ashblack and Blackbones are 
industrial districts, largely inhabited by warforged laborers and 
miserable workers of other races. It is said that House Cannith 
maintains a forgehold in the Ashblack district, and that this is where 
Baron Merrix d'Cannith conducts his experiments.</p><p>The Sharn Watch 
maintains a presence in the Cogs, and overseers from House Cannith are 
stationed here to keep things in order. Beyond these industrial 
districts lies the deeper tunnels of Khyber's Gate, a tenement district.</p><p>Blackbones
 has a number of remarkable locations. For example, the Pool of Onatar's
 Tears is sacred to the Sovereign of the Forge. The current caretaker is
 a warforged priest named Smith, who believes that Onatar has plans for 
the warforged, and that the warforged and creatures of flesh are meant 
to live together.</p><p>Most of the citizens of Sharn have never been to
 the Cogs. The area does house the bulk of the city's warforged 
population, and if you're looking for a particular warforged, it's the 
best place to start. Industrial espionage and labor struggles can add 
drama to adventures in the great foundries, not to mention the 
possibility of artificers with secret forges hidden in the Cogs.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="722" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dungeons of Sharn</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p177</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Sharn
 boasts countless opportunities for adventurers. You can get caught up 
in espionage in Upper Central or drawn into a crime war in Lower Dura. 
Aside from the intrigues and politics of the city, Sharn has a wide 
range of cursed ruins, haunted slums, shunned catacombs, and other 
dangerous places. Wise folk avoid these areas, but those whose hunger 
for adventure outweighs their good sense might do the opposite.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="723" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The City of the Dead</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p177</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Look
 to the cliffs to the north of Sharn, and you'll see a collection of 
crypts embedded into the cliff face. This is the City of the Dead, the 
final resting place of the wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Common folk are
 cremated after death, but members of the Sixty Families and others with
 sufficient wealth have their remains interred in the tombs and tunnels 
of this necropolis.</p><p>Few people reside in this area. Among its 
major features are Aureon's Holt, a temple of the Restful Watch, where 
Sovereign priests conduct funerals and serve as the caretakers of the 
tombs. Warden Tower is an outpost of the Church of the Silver Flame, 
staffed by a single hermit tasked to watch for supernatural threats.</p><p>Though
 the City of the Dead is largely peaceful, stories circulate about dark 
powers lurking there. Some parents warn their children of the 
Lich-Priest Gath, who steals disobedient children and forces them to 
work in his kingdom of the dead, polishing the bones of his skeletal 
subjects.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="724" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Old Sharn</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p177</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Sharn
 was built on the foundations of an older city, which was itself built 
atop goblin ruins. This old city was destroyed by dark magic, courtesy 
of the elemental powers of the infamous Halas Tarkanan and his consort, 
the Lady of the Plague. It is said that vile powers still linger in 
these ruins, and for this reason King Galifar I had all the passages to 
this undercity sealed with gates of metal and magic. These portals 
remain sealed today, and it's illegal to tamper with them. But it's 
generally assumed that many treasures are hidden in the ruins of Old 
Sharn, along with untold secrets of the past.</p><p>No one knows exactly
 what lurks in Old Sharn. The ruins could contain ghosts or other 
undead, the vengeful spirits of the aberrant-marked people who took

 hear warning bells toll tomorrow morning. You'll see packs of people 
with their faces hidden by plague masks or strips of cloth. Jorasco 
healers will roam the streets offering free examinations and blessings. 
If you're new to Sharn, have no fear! This isn't the outbreak of disease
 it appears to be; it's how Sharn observes the Lady's Day, commemorating
 a tragic incident in our past.</p><p>Today, aberrant dragonmarks are 
rare. But there was a time long ago when they were far more common. An 
army of aberrant heirs made their home here in the early days of Sharn, 
led by Halas Tarkanan—known as the Earthshaker—and the Lady of the 
Plague, who had power over vermin and disease. When the dragonmarked 
houses laid siege to the city and their defeat became inevitable, the 
two unleashed their full might. Tarkanan's power reduced the early 
towers to rubble, and the Lady of the Plague called forth a horde of 
disease-infested vermin.</p><p>For centuries afterward, the region was 
shunned. When our modern city was built, the cursed ruins were sealed 
away. But one never knows when the darkness could rise up again. On the 
Lady's Day, we remember the tragedy that once befell Sharn, and we 
prepare for the possibility that it could happen again.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>The
 Fallen district in Lower Dura was once known as Godsgate. When the 
first towers were raised, Godsgate was the temple district. It had 
shrines and statues dedicated to the Sovereigns, a proud church of the 
Silver Flame, even a monument to the Undying Court. But as Sharn grew 
and prospered, religious services were moved to grander temples in the 
upper wards. Godsgate became a tenement district, and the shrines and 
monuments were forgotten and left to decay. The final blow to this 
once-proud district came early in the Last War. A team of Aundairian 
saboteurs brought down one of Sharn's floating towers, and the falling 
spire struck Godsgate. Buildings collapsed, and hundreds died. Untended 
corpses led to infection and disease. The City Council had no interest 
in sinking gold into Lower Dura to restore the area, and the district 
was abandoned.</p><p>Today, the district known as Fallen is strewn with 
the rubble of the fallen tower, mingled with shattered buildings and 
broken statues. Those who venture into Fallen must deal with the Ravers,
 feral savages that lurk in the shadows. There's no question that the 
Ravers exist, but their true nature remains a subject of debate. A 
common hypothesis is that they're the descendants of the original 
inhabitants of the district, who were possessed and driven mad by the 
ghosts of those who died when the tower fell. Others claim that House 
Vadalis has been trying to magebreed super-soldiers, and the Ravers are 
the result of failed experiments.</p><p>Only the most desperate people 
live here, and the forces of the law won't come near it. As a result, 
the district has a lot of space available for any cult or secret society
 that needs a lair. The followers of a radiant idol, the Cult of the 
Dragon Below, or any other cabal could lay claim to a shattered church 
in Fallen.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="727" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Khyber's Gate</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p178</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Beyond

you're seeking the leaders of this group, this is where you'll find

from Droaam, but it's also home to fugitives, war criminals, and other

 upper wards of Sharn use a network of chutes to funnel garbage down 
into the sewers. Refuse and filth is channeled into cavernous midden 
chambers, where it is left to rot or be devoured by the vermin and oozes
 that inhabit the sewers. Smaller tunnels channel wastewater into 
purification centers, where magewrights use magic to cleanse the water. A
 special unit of the Sharn Watch protects the purification chambers. 
Beyond these small, vital areas, the sewers are lawless.</p><p>Though 
the sewers were never intended to support a population, over the 
centuries a subculture has evolved in this region. A few tribes of 
people—mostly goblins, along with a few shifters, dwarves, and feral 
halflings—live in the sewers, rummaging through the midden heaps and 
selling their goods in the lower city. These sewer clans constantly 
battle over territory, as control of one or more midden chamber can be 
critical to survival. The sewer clans can pose a threat to adventurers, 
but they can also be valuable allies; there are no better guides to the 
sewers and what lies beneath them than one of the folk who live there.</p></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="729" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Criminal Activities</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p178</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Under
 the laws of Sharn, crime takes many forms. Any sort of theft is 
illegal, including "malicious theft of identity"—the use of 
shapeshifting abilities or illusion magic to impersonate someone with 
the intent to cause harm. Assault, murder, and fraud will all land you 
in hot water. Other activities walk the edge of legality. Gambling and 
prostitution are legal in Sharn, but these industries are heavily taxed 
and regulated. Likewise, smuggled goods include illegal merchandise such
 as drugs and mystical explosives, but also heavily taxed goods, such as
 the drug known as dreamlily (described in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,11,crime%20in%20sharn,0">chapter 4</a>).</p><p>Although
 crime occurs throughout Sharn, it is most apparent in Lower Dura and 
the Cogs. The Sharn Watch has a minimal presence in these wards, which 
are the easiest places to sell stolen goods or to hire an assassin. Of 
course, they're also good places to get robbed or caught up in a street 
brawl.</p><p>Sharn is home to a large number of minor gangs and 
independent criminals. Even so, most criminal activities in the city 
come under the purview of one of four criminal organizations: the 
Boromar Clan, Daask, House Tarkanan, and the Tyrants. Even independents 
usually have an arrangement with one of these power groups. If your 
character has the criminal background, work with the DM to determine 
which of these organizations you're connected to (the DM has more 
information about these groups in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,11">chapter 4</a>).</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="730" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Boromar Clan</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p179</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Boromar Clan began as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta 
Plains. Today the Boromars are one of Sharn's most influential families;
 there's a Boromar on the City Council. Also, the Boromars have close 
ties by marriage to the local branch of House Jorasco, and clan members 
can be seen at every Skyway gala.</p><p>The Boromar Clan specializes in 
gambling, theft, and smuggling. In addition, it governs a wide network 
of lesser gangs and crime lords across the city. In the past, the clan's
 reputation was sufficiently strong to prevent any challenges. Over the 
last decade, however, the Boromars have been fending off a serious 
challenge from Daask. Those monsters have been aggressively targeting 
Boromar agents and holdings, and the feud between the two forces grows 
more heated all the time.</p><p>Having a connection to the Boromar Clan 
makes you part of the established power in Sharn. It's an organization 
that values tradition and prefers to avoid violence. As an associate of 
the clan, you'll be expected to respect the hierarchy and follow the 
rules, and you might be targeted by Daask just as if you were a Boromar 
yourself.</p><p>If you have a contact in the Boromar Clan, you might know someone on the Boromar Contacts table.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="731">Boromar Contacts</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 members of the King's Citadel are the direct agents of the Brelish 
Crown. As such, the King's Citadel stands above the Sharn Watch. Its 
members have the authority to take control of any investigation and to 
command the service of any guard or sentinel. Typically the Citadel 
leaves the daily chores of law enforcement (including the conflicts 
between the criminal organizations of the lower towers) in the hands of 
the Sharn Watch. The Citadel is concerned with forces that threaten the 
entire city, or even the kingdom. Foreign spies, mad necromancers, and 
ancient fiends—these are the foes of the King's Citadel, rather than 
pickpockets and burglars.</p><p>Of course, many of these greater threats
 might be beyond the capabilities of the typical Citadel agents. Much as
 the Blackened Book does, the Citadel keeps a close eye on unusual and 
talented individuals, and a party of adventurers might be called upon to
 assist the Citadel in a dangerous mission.</p><p>Unlike the Sharn 
Watch, the Citadel doesn't ask for help: it demands it. The knights of 
the Citadel are the representatives of the King of Breland, and any 
Brelish citizen who refuses to help them is committing an act of 
treason. The Citadel isn't required to provide compensation for the 
services it demands, but an adventurer who wins the respect of the 
Citadel can certainly benefit from the relationship.</p><p>The Citadel is made up of these four divisions:</p><p><b>The King's Dark Lanterns</b> gather intelligence and engage in covert operations.</p><p><b>The King's Shields</b> protect the royal family and its closest associates.</p><p><b>The King's Swords</b> are elite soldiers used in the most dangerous military operations.</p><p><b>The King's Wands</b> are wizards and sorcerers, serving the crown in all arcane matters.</p><p>The
 headquarters of the Citadel is in the Ambassador Towers district of 
Middle Central, in Andith Tower. That structure also serves as the city 
jail.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="742" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Redcloak Battalion</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p181</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion are among the deadliest warriors in 
Sharn. When a situation calls for extreme military force, both the Sharn
 Watch and the King's Citadel turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite
 unit fought in the forefront of the Last War, and the bards in Menthis 
today sing of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress.
 At the end of the war, the battalion was split up, and one unit was 
assigned to Sharn. Its headquarters is located in the Daggerwatch 
district of Upper Dura.</p><p>Many of the members of the Redcloak 
Battalion resent being relegated to mere law enforcement, and there is a
 strong rivalry between the Redcloaks and the King's Swords of the 
Citadel, who generally have less military experience even though they 
enjoy far greater authority and prestige.</p><p>As veterans and heroes 
of the Last War, many of the Redcloaks are unfriendly toward travelers 
from other nations. As far as the Redcloaks are concerned, the Treaty of
 Thronehold is merely an intermission, and soon King Boranel will come

offense, the perpetrator is taken to a garrison and held until a trial 
can be arranged. A criminal who is considered to be a serious flight 
risk will be taken to the most secure facility in Sharn—the King's 
Citadel headquarters.</p><p>Typically, a prisoner's case comes to the attention of a local magistrate within <span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll. SHIFT/CTRL to roll twice." onmousedown="event.preventDefault()" data-packed-dice="{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;dice&quot;,&quot;rollable&quot;:true,&quot;toRoll&quot;:&quot;1d4&quot;}">1d4</span>
 days. The magistrate reviews the facts of the case and asks the victim 
to confirm or deny their role in the crime while under the influence of a
 <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#zone%20of%20truth_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="zone%20of%20truth_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">zone of truth</a> spell. The magistrate will then propose a punishment to the accused; if the offer is refused, the case goes to trial.</p><p>Punishment
 for convicted criminals varies, but long-term imprisonment is quite 
rare. Prisoners who deemed to be too dangerous to be allowed to roam 
free are more likely to be executed than imprisoned. Typically, a long 
prison sentence is used only for criminals who can't be allowed to go 
free, but whose deaths would have negative diplomatic repercussions.</p><p>Fines
 are the typical form of punishment. The amount of a fine is generally 
based on the nature of the crime, but a magistrate has the right to 
increase a fine to ensure that it is an effective punishment. For 
example, a fine of 10 gp is crippling to a commoner but can be 
inconsequential to an adventurer or a member of the Aurum, and in such 
cases it will be increased. Also, the court can confiscate possessions 
in lieu of receiving payments in gold; you might not care about having 
to pay a fine of 100 gp, but having your grandfather's magic sword 
confiscated instead might sting. If a criminal can't afford to pay a 
fine, the sentence might be changed to hard labor—or, in the case of 
adventurers, performing special services on behalf of the city or the 
Crown.</p><p>Other kinds of punishment include branding (generally in a 
visible location, warning others of your criminal actions), exile, or 
several magical measures: an ongoing curse, a period of induced 
blindness, and so on. A repeat offender might be declared an outlaw, 
which status is often indicated by a brand. An outlaw is stripped of the
 protection of the law, and anyone can take any action against them 
without fear of legal retribution.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="744" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chapter 4: Building Eberron Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p183</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Get

 Think of this chapter as an extensive library of ideas—villainous 
schemes, interesting locations, adventure hooks, encounters, and more—to
 help you flesh out an adventure you create for your Eberron campaign.</p><p>This
 chapter begins with a look at three key themes that pervade many 
Eberron adventures: recurring villains, action, and intrigue. Following 
that overview is an in-depth look at various organizations and other 
elements you can use to drive the adventures you create. Such elements 
include maps of locations that can serve as thrilling set pieces; 
information on the planes of existence, elemental-powered airships, and 
the lightning rail; and an introductory adventure set in Sharn.</p><p>Specific monsters and nonplayer characters (NPCs) mentioned in this chapter can be found either in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#MM">Monster Manual</a> or in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>

 group of adventurers leaves the dark, rainy city, putting its mean 
streets behind them. They board a flame-ringed airship for a journey 
across the continent, but they're attacked by wyvern-riding bandits on 
the way and must fight for their lives as the airship hurtles toward the
 ground!</p><p>After surviving the crash through a combination of quick 
thinking and heroic effort, they find themselves stranded in the gray 
mists of the Mournland, facing the dangers of a war-ravaged land as they
 try to find their way back to their original destination. The greatest 
horrors they are about to face might be the ones that lurk in the depths
 of their own hearts.</p><p>As discussed in the introduction to this 
book, pulp adventure and noir intrigue are two major themes that 
interlace in Eberron. Weaving these themes together, or exploring either
 one in isolation, can give Eberron stories a unique feel. Adventures 
that take advantage of those themes help to reinforce a sense of place, 
immersing the players (and you) in a world that is still reeling from 
the effects of a hundred years of war, that is shaped by modern ideas 
and aesthetics, and that is set apart from the rest of the D&amp;D 
multiverse by a magical barrier.</p><p>This section is an introduction 
to those themes, designed to help you tell stories that fit well in 
Eberron. It explores techniques for making compelling recurring 
villains, and for keeping the action moving over the course of an 
adventure. It discusses how to use the Last War as a theme and a setting
 for adventures, and details the Mournland as an adventure location. It 
goes on to describe adventures and encounters that can occur in 
transit—on airships, on lightning rails, and at resting spots along the 
way. Finally, this section discusses the role that creatures typically 
defined as "monsters" play in Khorvaire, and explores Eberron's 
cosmology.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="747" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Recurring Villains</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p183</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 most effective villains are the ones that return, over and over, to 
plague their heroic nemeses. When the heroes foil the schemes of an evil
 mastermind, the clever villain escapes to fight another day. A 
well-developed recurring villain can put a face to the sinister 
conspiracies that lurk in the darkness and thus strengthen the players' 
sense of immersion in the world.</p><p>You can make a recurring villain 
in your campaign more intriguing by introducing moral ambiguity into the
 villain's background, possibly through references to the individual's 
experiences during the Last War.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="748" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Write of Passage—Back from the dead?</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p183</span></span><p>It was too good to be true.</p><p>A

 first task in crafting a good recurring villain is ensuring that the 
villain survives a first encounter with the adventurers in order to come
 back and plague them again. What follows are some tactics to make sure 
that even the most resourceful characters can't dispose of your villain 
at the first possible opportunity.</p><p><b>Have Lackeys Do the Work.</b>
 A villain can easily postpone that first face-to-face confrontation 
with the adventurers by having lackeys soften the party up, all the 
while making sure that the adventurers know whom they work for—thus 
enhancing the villain's reputation.</p><p><b>Use All Available Resources.</b>
 A smart villain, especially one with access to magic, can put a lot of 
obstacles in the way of an adventuring party. Mechanical and magical 
traps, wards against divination, and protective magic items are just a 
few of the security measures available to a resourceful villain. Keep in
 mind that reports from surviving lackeys—and news about the adventurers
 from other sources—can give the villain enough information about the 
party's capabilities to prepare appropriate countermeasures.</p><p><b>Have an Escape Plan.</b>
 Secret passages, spells of invisibility or teleportation, flying 
mounts, and throngs of minions can help a villain escape when a 
confrontation with the adventurers goes badly. Any villain likely has at
 least one fallback plan.</p><p><b>Take Hostages</b>. Most adventurers 
wouldn't be willing to attack the villain if they fear that the 
villains' lackeys are about to slaughter innocent captives the moment 
they draw their swords.</p><p><b>Returning from Death</b>. Of course, 
death is not a final fate for player characters, and it doesn't need to 
be for villains either. After the adventurers kill their nemesis, they 
might next encounter the villain raised from the dead or as an undead. 
It's conceivable that dying could make a villain more powerful and more 
angry at the meddling adventurers. Alternatively, the characters might 
assume a villain is dead—after falling over a waterfall, being trapped 
in a burning building, or getting swallowed by a purple worm—only to 
discover later that the villain survived and is hungry for revenge.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="750" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Improving Villains</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p184</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Adventurers
 get more powerful over time, so if a villain is going to remain a 
relevant threat, the villain needs to get more powerful as well. There 
are three ways you can approach this issue:</p><p><b>Mechanical Improvement</b>. Use the guidelines in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,9,modifying%20a%20monster,0">chapter 9</a> of the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>
 to add class levels or Hit Dice to the villain and improve its 
challenge rating to make it relevant to the higher-level characters.</p><p><b>NPC Stat Blocks</b>. Some of the stat blocks in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#MM">Monster Manual</a>
 can reflect the same character at different stages of advancement. For 
example, the adventurers might confront a villain who uses the stat 
block of a <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mage_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="mage_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">mage</a> (9th-level wizard) and then returns later as an <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#archmage_mm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="MM" data-vet-hash="archmage_mm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">archmage</a>
 (18th-level wizard). You could also use stat blocks in other sources to
 add to the sequence, so the characters could even meet this aspiring 
villain as an <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#apprentice%20wizard_vgm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="VGM" data-vet-hash="apprentice%20wizard_vgm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">apprentice wizard</a> and later as an <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#evoker_vgm" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="VGM" data-vet-hash="evoker_vgm" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">evoker</a> (both in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#VGM">Volo's Guide to Monsters</a>).</p><p><b>Organizations as Villains</b>.
 Rather than use an individual as a recurring villain, you could think 
in terms of the organization the villain belongs to or represents. For 
example, low-level adventurers might fight low-level agents of the Order
 of the Emerald Claw and grow to loathe the sight of their claw-shaped 
symbol and green cloaks. As they attain higher levels, the characters 
will face increasingly more powerful members of the order.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="751" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Shades of Evil</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p184</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Moral
 ambiguity is a feature of the noir genre that can add richness and 
complexity to an Eberron adventure. In a world where a red dragon isn't 
necessarily evil (and a bronze one isn't necessarily good), it's 
impossible to know who you can trust, and even the actions of a 
so-called villain might not fit neatly into clear-cut definitions of 
good and evil. Even adventure villains are more often driven by human 
motives than by cosmic concepts of good and evil. People sometimes do 
evil things for good reasons.</p><p>Exercise some caution when exploring
 these noir themes in the stories you develop. It can be fun for some 
people to wrestle with moral quandaries in adventures, but it doesn't 
work for all play groups. In particular, if there's no good solution to 
the quandary—if the characters have no choice but to follow a course of 
action they abhor—some players might end up unhappy.</p><p>The Morally 
Ambiguous Villains table offers some twists you can add to the villains 
in this chapter, giving them more or less good reasons to perform their 
evil deeds.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="752">Morally Ambiguous Villains</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 every villain is a mastermind who schemes in the shadows or a 
world-destroying horror. Sometimes the most significant villain is 
someone the characters see every day—someone who moves around society in
 plain sight but keeps their evil deeds well hidden. The law enforcers 
and adventurers who are trying to bring the villain to justice are 
thwarted at every turn, unable to find proof of the villain's crimes. If
 the players come to loathe the villain, everything is going according 
to plan.</p><p>Use the Villain You Know table to add some depth and

		</div></div><p></p><p>In contrast to a villain who is a part of the 
characters' everyday life, an otherworldly villain isn't only anonymous 
but also fundamentally mysterious. It's not just a question of <i>who</i> the villain is, but also of <i>what</i>
 the villain is, and what extraordinary measures might be required to 
put a stop to their villainy. Even after the adventurers discover that 
their long-term nemesis is one of the Inspired, for example, they still 
need to learn the secrets of the Inspired and their quori masters in 
order to figure out how to deal with this threat.</p><p>Sometimes the 
mystery is enough to make such a villain compelling, with curiosity 
driving the adventurers to delve ever deeper into their foe's secrets. 
When the time is right, you can turn a mysterious villain into an 
unnervingly familiar villain—as a quori spirit takes delight in speaking
 through the mouths of multiple different Inspired hosts, taunting the 
adventurers for their inability to reach the spirit itself. Then 
resentment combines with curiosity to drive the adventurers to further 
exploration. When characters dig deeply into the mysteries of the world,
 your campaign benefits as they become more immersed in and attached to 
the setting.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="756" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ultimate Evil.</span></span> <p>Some
 mysterious villains wield enough power to threaten the entire world

These villains typically lurk in the shadows, pulling the strings of 
minions and partners while rarely making an appearance themselves. These

 in the noir tradition tend to start slowly and build gradually as the

 climactic confrontation. In contrast to the pulse-pounding action of a

word—to keep the protagonists engaged as they move deeper into the

 the surface, the Aurum appears to be an exclusive society for the 
richest and most influential people of Khorvaire. Merchants, priests, 
military officers, and other luminaries gather for grand galas and 
salons. Beneath this gilded veneer, the members of the Aurum use their 
shared wealth and power to pursue their selfish goals, and a secret 
cabal at the heart of this fraternity dreams of global domination.</p><p>The
 Aurum is divided into four suborders called Concords—copper, silver, 
gold, and platinum, in order of ascendance. Higher rank provides a 
member with improved access to the resources of the Aurum and a greater 
voice in society meetings. The Aurum isn't a secret society, and its 
meeting halls can be found in most major cities. Many powerful people 
openly wear the eight rings—one on each finger, with the metal 
indicating the rank of the wearer—that label them as Aurum members. The 
Aurum frequently engages in acts of philanthropy, and thus some members 
might be celebrated by their local communities.</p><p>When members 
gather, they discuss shared interests, especially in history and 
archaeology. Aurum members often take an interest in a particular 
civilization or era of history; one Concordian collects relics of the 
Cul'sir giants of Xen'drik, while another pursues artifacts of the 
dragons of Argonnessen. One of the most common ways in which adventurers
 cross paths with the Aurum is through these collectors. Members of the 
Aurum often fund expeditions to exotic lands or newly discovered ruins, 
interested in expanding their private hoards. Occasionally a Concordian 
tries to acquire prized relics through less honorable means; adventurers
 could be employed to acquire an exotic prize from a rival through any 
means necessary, legal or otherwise.</p><p>All of these activities are 
entirely legitimate. The Aurum is a society for wealthy scholars and 
philanthropists. But there is a secret order that ranks higher than the 
Platinum Concord—an inner circle known as the Shadow Cabinet. The 
members of this cabal are nobles but not kings; they are powerful 
industrialists, but not dragonmarked barons. They are determined to 
become the true rulers of Khorvaire, whether by binding the current 
barons and monarchs to their will or by tearing down the current systems
 and creating something new.</p><p>In stories driven by action, the 
Aurum can fund expeditions to exotic lands and use magical doomsday 
devices to hold cities for ransom. In adventures driven by intrigue, the
 Aurum provides an opportunity to explore the lure of gold, and how far 
the characters might go in the service of an amoral patron.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="770" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Aurum and the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p187</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Last War gave birth to the Shadow Cabinet. The war ignited the passions
 of Concordians who blamed the monarchs of the Five Nations for the vast
 devastation and loss. It also created opportunities that never existed 
under the united Galifar. Many of the members of the Aurum gained 
influence by bankrolling one or more war efforts, or by stepping in to 
maintain the infrastructure while the government directed its attention 
to military matters. The Aurum also includes a number of powerful 
military officers and warlords. Some despise the nobles that drove them 
to war; others are furious that the war ended without a decisive 
victory. Either way, these can provide the Shadow Cabinet with 
unexpected military power.</p><p>Now, amid the war's cooling ashes, the 
Aurum's power is fragmented. On several occasions, investments and 
gambles that paid dividends in money and power to one Concordian sapped 
the fortune of another, because each was unknowingly working against the
 other's interests. Huge collections of art, historical artifacts, and 
precious tomes were destroyed or lost during the war, and the Aurum's 
leaders salivate at the thought of recovering some of those riches.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="771" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aurum NPCs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p187</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Aurum
 Concordians are defined by their wealth and power. When you create an 
Aurum NPC, consider the source of that person's wealth and how it is 
expressed. The dwarf Antus ir'Soldorak is chancellor of the Platinum 
Concord and founder of the Shadow Cabinet. He owns vast gold and silver 
mines in the Mror Holds and mints his own currency, and he travels in a 
gilded airship. Loyal Daison is a Karrnathi slumlord who has made a 
fortune providing low-rent (and low-quality) housing for refugees. He 
lost his hand in an industrial accident and had it replaced with a 
golden prosthetic.</p><p>Members of the Aurum become villains if their 
quest for greater influence, personal power, and wealth victimizes the 
innocent. Whether villains or allies, all Concordians wield significant 
political influence. They have access to minions and resources in the 
higher levels of society. They prefer to pursue schemes of coercion and 
conspiracy, putting their money and influence to work, than resort to 
blatant violence in any form.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="772">Aurum NPCs</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 easy to introduce the Aurum to the characters early in a campaign. Its 
members are public figures, sometimes eccentric but not necessarily 
evil. A Concordian could hire the adventurers to solve a mystery or to 
acquire a harmless curio. A Concordian could be tied to the party's 
group patron (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4">chapter 1</a>)—the owner of the newspaper, a major donor to the university, or the power behind a criminal syndicate.</p><p>Alternatively,
 an Aurum Concordian can be a behind-the-scenes villain: low-level 
adventurers could clash with the Concordian's hired goons as they pursue
 the same treasure, or the adventurers could be trying to solve a 
mystery the thugs are covering up. As the campaign progresses, the 
characters might face higher-ranking members of the Aurum, or recurring 
mercenaries who are increasing in power and status at the same rate they
 are.</p><p>Whether they interact with the Aurum as ally or enemy, at 
some point the adventurers might well realize that the Concordians 
aren't just greedy plutocrats, but participants in an international 
conspiracy. The Aurum's arc in the campaign might climax with the 
characters learning of the Shadow Cabinet and thwarting one of its grand
 schemes.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="774" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aurum Missions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p188</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 no organizing structure or principle. They are an infection inflicted

patron. Even cults associated with the same master might not recognize 
one another as allies. You can roll on the Cult of the Dragon Below 
table to get a quick description of a cult, or you can create something

 of the Dragon Below make versatile villains in a campaign. They can be 
introduced as a threat early on, in the form of low-level cultists and 
small, disorganized cells. As the campaign moves through the tiers of 
play, stronger aberrations and fiends become viable antagonists, as well
 as more powerful cult leaders who serve the daelkyr, the Lords of Dust,
 or other dark entities.</p><p>The cults can also serve different styles
 of play. One would be perfect for a slowly unfolding investigation that
 starts out seemingly mundane, but slowly delves deeper into 
otherworldly influences and dark magic. Allies become suspect, and 
perhaps even erstwhile enemies become necessary bedfellows.</p><p>Alternatively,
 a cult can burst explosively onto the scene with a spray of gore and a 
horde of shrieking dolgaunts. Such an incident leaves no doubt about the
 cultists' evil nature, making them the obvious villains of the story.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="782" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cult Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p189</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The Cult Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for story opportunities involving the cults.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="783">Cult Adventure Hooks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 other group exerts as much influence over the Five Nations as the 
combined membership of the dragonmarked houses. Each dragonmarked house 
is part noble family and part business cartel, involved in businesses 
ranging from hospitality to espionage-for-hire.</p><p>The reach of the 
houses is so extensive that they have interests in every facet of life 
in the civilized lands of Khorvaire and beyond. Those interests often 
bring them into conflict with local rulers and national governments. 
Unified Galifar had the strength and influence to impose its will on the
 collected dragonmarked houses, but in the wake of the war it remains to
 be seen if any single nation has the resources to challenge them.</p><p>Although
 most houses have distinct spheres of interest, their concerns overlap 
just enough to cause friction. House Orien's control of transportation 
and shipping is threatened by the growing reach of House Lyrandar's 
airships. House Tharashk's arrangement with Droaam threatens House 
Deneith's monopoly on providing mercenary services. House Cannith lost 
its leadership in the Mourning, and rival barons are fighting for 
control of the house.</p><p>An organization called the Twelve seeks to 
mediate disputes and encourage cooperation between the houses. 
Adventurers could be caught up in the rivalries and schemes of the 
houses, or they could work with the Twelve in an effort to resolve these
 feuds.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="785" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Houses in the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p190</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 dragonmarked houses generally thrived during the Last War. Each house's
 unique talents were easily adapted to the war effort. Ostensibly 
neutral in the conflict, the houses made huge profits by selling 
services and material to every nation involved in the war. For all the 
houses, ultimately, the war years were a time of vigorous growth and 
increased influence.</p><p>In some ways, though, the dragonmarked houses
 did feel the brunt of the conflict. House Cannith, for instance, 
suffered great setbacks near the end of the war. Many of its foundries 
and factories were destroyed, and the Treaty of Thronehold forced the 
house to dismantle the creation forges that produced the warforged. 
Worst of all for the house, the destruction of Cyre left Cannith without
 a clear leader, resulting in the house being fragmented into three 
semi-independent branches.</p><p>In another major development, House 
Thuranni broke away from House Phiarlan during the war, in part because 
of the conflicts of interest that arose within an espionage organization
 that was being called on to serve multiple sides in a complex conflict.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="786" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Arcane Workshop</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p190</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Map

 reach and influence of the dragonmarked houses means that they can play
 many roles in a campaign. Dragonmarked heirs can be valuable patrons. 
Dragonmarked villains usually covet magical knowledge, wealth, or 
influence, and their methods are appropriate to the marks they bear. 
Dragonmarked agents can range from lowly spies bearing the Mark of 
Shadow hidden within a circus troupe, to a dragonmarked warlord of House
 Deneith who has decided to establish their own fiefdom. Examples of

 dragonmarked houses provide an opportunity for your campaign to explore
 the role of magic in society and the power of industry in the postwar 
world. If the adventurers are allied with a dragonmarked house, you can 
concentrate on the house's positive aspects and its work in moving 
Khorvaire beyond the feudalism of Galifar. At the same time, the houses 
also represent a way to explore the consequences of corporate greed and 
unrestrained expansion. This self-interest can be a defining feature of 
some or all of the houses, or you can focus on factions within certain 
houses, with idealistic leaders seeking to direct the house along a more
 responsible path while barons are driven by greed alone.</p><p>As a 
prominent part of society, the dragonmarked houses strive to maintain 
the appearance of respectability and propriety. Thus, even when a house 
is utterly corrupted, any agents who are caught in their evil deeds are 
quickly and convincingly disavowed, preserving the house's image and 
reputation. If the plays a significant, recurring role as a villain in 
your campaign, the characters' eventual task will be to prove that these
 so-called "rogue agents" have actually been taking orders from the top 
of the house's leadership.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="795" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dragonmarked House Adventure Hooks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p192</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The Dragonmarked House Adventure Hooks table presents a few ways to pull characters into tales concerning the houses.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="796">Dragonmarked House Adventure Hooks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 dragons of Eberron are much more than mere monsters; adventurers will 
rarely barge into a dragon's lair in search of its treasure horde. 
Dragons in the world are either aloof and unapproachable, or they are 
curious and manipulative, pulling strings behind the scenes or trying to
 influence the world in arcane ways.</p><p>Most dragons live on the 
mystery-shrouded continent of Argonnessen and avoid contact with those 
they see as lesser creatures. They are obsessed with the Draconic 
Prophecy, which is a map of possible futures rather than a clear-cut 
prediction. Its paths are revealed in the motion of planes and moons, in
 the actions of the dragonmarked houses, and in dozens of other more 
subtle manifestations. Most dragons that are active in Khorvaire are 
part of a cabal known as the Chamber.</p><p>A dragon in Khorvaire that 
isn't part of the Chamber could be an exile driven from Argonnessen for 
some crime or a scholar pursuing independent research. Some orphaned 
dragons grow up in Khorvaire without contact with Argonnessen, and some 
dragons have been twisted by the daelkyr or corrupted by fiends; any of 
these could be an antagonist if the adventure you're crafting calls for a
 cruel dragon.</p><p>The dragons of Eberron aren't restricted in 
alignment—good red dragons and evil gold dragons are equally common. 
Most dragons tend toward neutrality. Even those with good alignments 
often don't consider the impact of their actions on lesser beings; if a 
Chamber dragon must destroy a human village to foil the plans of a 
demon, it will do so without hesitation.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="798" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Chamber</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p193</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Conspiracy
 theorists insist that a network of dragons is hidden in Khorvaire, and 
these mighty creatures use powerful magic and humanoid agents to work 
their will across the continent and beyond. These claims are usually 
dismissed as madness, but they are in fact correct. The Chamber is a 
cabal of dragons that have monitored Khorvaire for thousands of years, 
treating humanoids as pawns in an ancient game.</p><p>First and 
foremost, the dragons of the Chamber are observers, gathering 
information about new aspects of the Prophecy and sharing it with their 
elders in Argonnessen. They are also charged with stopping any creature 
that seeks to use the Prophecy for its own ends. This responsibility 
sets them against the Lords of Dust, who must manipulate the Prophecy in
 order to release their fiendish overlords. It also leads them to 
recruit or eliminate any humanoid who learns too much about the 
Prophecy.</p><p>The Chamber is loosely organized. Each dragon monitors 
its own small corner of the world and maintains a network of humanoid 
agents. Although the mission of the Chamber is one of observation, 
individual dragons often have their own agendas. Some seek to manipulate
 the Prophecy personally, directing the future along a particular path. 
Others conduct experiments on dragonmarked humanoids, trying to 
understand the connection between these creatures and the Prophecy. 
Still others are obsessed with the Lords of Dust engage in 
century-spanning games of cat-and-mouse with their fiendish 
counterparts. In general, the Chamber seeks to maintain the status quo 
and opposes demons, so agents of the Chamber can often be useful allies 
or patrons. But ultimately humanoids are just pawns in the dragons' 
eyes, and they readily sacrifice any of those pawns to ensure the 
sanctity of the Prophecy and the defeat of the Lords of Dust.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="799" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Chamber and the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p193</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 lives of humanoids and the welfare of their nations mean little to the 
ancient dragons. A member of the Chamber who is friendly now might turn 
out to be little more than a war criminal, responsible for horrible 
atrocities while directing critical events of the war to ensure that a 
skirmish or an untimely assassination didn't derail some crucial stanza 
of the Prophecy. An even more disturbing prospect is that the Mourning 
might have been orchestrated by the Chamber, either as part of its 
struggle against the Lords of Dust or even directly in response to the 
dictates of the Prophecy.</p><p>Whatever the truth, the Last War's 
impact on the Chamber was small in the grand scheme of things. Planar 
observatories were damaged here and there, humanoid servants died in 
droves, and the clash of armies derailed short-term plans. But even the 
effects of a hundred years of war are minor in the context of plans that
 span continents and millennia.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="800" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Planar Observatory</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p193</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A
 planar observatory is a structure at the heart of the Chamber's efforts
 to divine the meaning of the draconic Prophecy. The observatory 
consists of great chambers of crystal and metal, lined with huge 
orreries that track and align with the planes and the Ring of Siberys.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="801" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Planar Observatory Features</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p193</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Map
 4.2 shows what a planar observatory might look like. These immense 
locations are constructed by and for dragons. The orreries that surround
 the central space track the courses of the planes as they shift toward 
and away from Eberron. All about the observatory are enormous 
dragonshards of all three kinds (Eberron, Khyber, and Siberys).</p><p>Each
 observatory must be built in a location that is balanced between 
Siberys and Khyber; finding such a site might take years of careful 
study and surveying, and these places are typically remote. Several are 
located in Argonnessen; those in Khorvaire are usually found in mountain
 ranges and hidden forest clearings. Many have crystal roofs, or domes 
that open with the aid of great mechanisms to allow an unobstructed view
 of the night sky, since the movements of Eberron's moons are thought to
 correspond to the shifting relationships among the planes.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="802" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Planar Observatory Adventures</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p193</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 characters might find their way to a planar observatory as unwitting 
minions of a Chamber observer, as a destination in their struggles 
against servants of the Lords of Dust, or even accidentally. The Planar 
Observatory Adventures table presents some possibilities.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="803">

 a campaign featuring the Chamber, the adventurers might initially carry
 out simple tasks on behalf of a disguised dragon or secret Chamber 
agent, not necessarily doing anything shady or villainous, but 
maneuvering pieces into position so they can play their designated 
parts. As the campaign unfolds, the dragons of the Chamber might reveal 
that the adventurers have their own part to play—in particular, perhaps,
 any member of the party who bears a dragonmark. The Chamber begins 
interfering in the characters' activities, for good and for ill, and the
 Lords of Dust might also get involved. Unfortunately for the 
adventurers, the dragons are not necessarily any more concerned for 
their well-being than the Lords of Dust are, and the characters might 
have to consort or cooperate with demons in order to escape the clutches
 of the dragons.</p><p>Throughout the campaign, the goals of the Chamber
 might not be readily apparent. Locations such as the planar observatory
 described here might be able to give the adventurers some insight into 
the substance of the Prophecy they have become tangled up in, and seers 
and sages might be able to offer further insight into the different ways
 that the demons and the dragons could be interpreting those words. 
Ultimately, the adventurers might be in the position of having to choose
 between an outcome that is bad for them but good for the world in the 
long term, or a short-term triumph that carries tremendous risk for the 
world in the distant (or not too distant) future.</p><p>Another 
possibility is that the adventurers are openly working with the Chamber 
to gather information on the Prophecy and fight the Lords of Dust. In 
this case, the Chamber could act as a group patron; see the "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4,immortal%20being,0">Immortal Being</a>" section of <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4">chapter 1</a>.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="809" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Chamber Missions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p195</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 the spaces between sleeping and waking, nightmares wait with grasping 
claws. The quori spirits that rule Dal Quor spent a thousand years 
seizing control of the continent of Sarlona. Now they have turned their 
many eyes toward Khorvaire. The ultimate goal of the Dreaming Dark is to
 control all the nations of the world. The plane of Dal Quor goes 
through cycles of light and darkness, and the current age is coming to 
an end. The nightmare spirits that rule the plane believe that by 
seizing control of mortal civilization—by forcing all the people of 
Eberron to dream the dreams they devise—they can maintain this current 
age of darkness indefinitely. So the fiends of the Dreaming Dark aren't 
merely hungry for power; they are fighting for survival.</p><p>The quori
 can't manifest physically in Eberron, but they have other options. They
 can possess willing humanoids, creating agents known as the <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#inspired_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="inspired_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Inspired</a> (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>).
 They can also manipulate the dreams of mortals. The Dreaming Dark can 
trick a priest by sending dreams that appear to be divine visions, or 
inspire a soldier to rebel against their lord.</p><p>The greatest weapon
 of the Dreaming Dark is its ability to infiltrate other organizations. 
Anyone could become an Inspired vessel, or be prompted into taking 
foolish action by a dream. Its agents are scattered across the world and
 have no obvious connection to one another, until they reveal their true
 nature and purpose.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="812" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Dreaming Dark in the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p196</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 chaos that reigned during the Last War enabled the agents of the 
Dreaming Dark to move and act with absolute freedom throughout 
Khorvaire. Any direct conflict among Eberron's humanoid populations is a
 boon to this group, which wants to destabilize all of them. Many of the
 intense battles near the end of the war might have been avoided, if not
 for Dreaming Dark agents fanning the flames of fear and hate—often by 
invading the dreams of soldiers and rulers alike.</p><p>The feelings of 
mistrust and festering animosity between the nations that linger after 
the Treaty of Thronehold provide the Dreaming Dark with countless points
 of possible infection. Refugees, expatriates, and other displaced 
people provide the perfect vehicle for the Dreaming Dark to spread its 
influence across Khorvaire, carrying its corruption into new 
populations.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="813" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Role of Dreams</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p196</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>If
 you plan to use the Dreaming Dark as a major villain in your campaign, 
it can be helpful to establish the role of dreams early on. If dreams 
feel like a regular part of the story, it will be less obvious when the 
Dreaming Dark starts manipulating the characters' dreams. For example, 
you might establish a pattern of picking one adventurer and discussing 
their dreams each time the group takes a long rest. Consider these ideas
 for the basic seed of a dream:</p><p><b>Revisit recent events</b>. This
 can be a useful opportunity to call attention to a detail the 
characters overlooked. Clearly, this character's subconscious registered
 the detail as important!</p><p><b>Involve a current villain.</b> This can help build the players' hatred for an elusive recurring villain!</p><p><b>Foreshadow the future</b>.
 This could simply reflect a character's fears, but it might also convey
 a warning from a celestial or other supernatural creature.</p><p><b>Explore the character's past.</b> Give the player an opportunity to add depth to one element of the character's story.</p><p><b>Reflect anxiety</b>.
 An anxious character might dream about showing up in a dungeon with no 
armor or at school with no clothes. Narratively, these dreams can 
provide a moment of comic relief or heighten the players own concern 
about what's happening in the game.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="814" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Role of Dreams</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p196</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>All

 possible for an entire adventure to take place in a dream. The trick 
with a dream adventure is ensuring that it feels meaningful, even 
consequential, and not just a waste of time. One of four basic 
approaches can help you do that:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">A
 real monster inhabits a character's dreams and poses a real threat to 
that character's mind or body. The goal of the adventure is to defeat 
that monster.</li><li class="rd__li ">A dreaming character is incapable 
of waking communication—they might be comatose or possessed. The goal of
 the adventure is to communicate with the dreamer and free them from 
whatever is preventing them from communicating.</li><li class="rd__li ">A
 villain has implanted some kind of psychic lock in a character's mind, 
which prevents them from accessing some knowledge or capability. The 
goal of the adventure is to remove the psychic lock, which might take 
the form of a complex trap or maze in the dream.</li><li class="rd__li ">The
 actual objective of the adventure lies in Dal Quor. The first goal is 
to find a way to break out of the mundane dreamscape and enter the wider
 plane.</li></ul><p>The second challenge in crafting a dream adventure 
is how to bring all the characters in a party together in the same 
dream, which might or might not belong to one of them. Consider these 
possibilities:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">One of the characters is dreaming, and the others appear in the dream as memories and impressions in the dreamer's mind.</li><li class="rd__li ">Some
 exotic magic—a kalashtar ritual or an eldritch machine, perhaps—allows 
the characters to share a dream or to enter someone else's dream. This 
magic could also allow a character who ordinarily can't dream (such as 
an elf, a warforged, or a kalashtar) to enter the dreamscape as well.</li><li class="rd__li ">Agents
 of the Dreaming Dark use their magic to bring the dreams of the 
characters together so they can influence or target the whole party at 
once.</li></ul><p>The Dream Adventures table puts these principles together and suggests hooks into this kind of adventure.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="815">Dream Adventures</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 ago, the Dreaming Dark caused a long period of strife on the continent 
of Sarlona, fostering suspicion, rebellion, fear, prejudice, and greed 
among and within the various nations that held power at the time. While 
chaos reigned, the quori also carefully nurtured the human bloodlines 
that would become the Inspired, perfectly suited to serve as hosts for 
quori spirits. Then, when the destruction of the old kingdoms was 
complete, a group of bold champions—Inspired vessels of the Dreaming 
Dark—formed a new nation from the ashes of the old. Having conquered 
Sarlona by means of such manipulation, the Dreaming Dark has turned its 
sights to Khorvaire—which is already a continent in turmoil.</p><p>With 
the conquest of the entire continent in mind, the Dreaming Dark has 
three objectives in Khorvaire. The first is to cause chaos and strife 
whenever possible, turning allies against one another and spreading 
fear. The second is to promote their chosen champions. A champion could 
be a nation, a mercenary company, a dragonmarked house, or a 
religion—whatever it is, it will have been thoroughly subverted by the 
Dreaming Dark. Finally, the Dreaming Dark relentlessly pursues the 
kalashtar and takes every opportunity to bring down these enemies. The 
kalashtar are descended from rebel quori that defied the Dreaming Dark 
and want to push Dal Quor into an age of light.</p><p>Given those 
objectives, the Dreaming Dark can drive events on a small scale, by 
setting bandits in motion or triggering local feuds, or the adventurers 
might uncover evidence of plans that could reignite the Last War or 
bring an entire nation or religion under the sway of the Dreaming Dark.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="820" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dreaming Dark Adventure Hooks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p197</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 Droaam was a wild frontier that marked the edge of civilized Khorvaire.
 Today, it is home to one of the strangest nations on the continent. In 
the streets of the Great Crag, ogres and minotaurs rub shoulders with 
gnolls and goblins. Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the sky, while 
harpies call work crews to the quarries with their songs. Under the rule
 of the enigmatic Daughters of Sora Kell, this land grows stronger with 
each passing year.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="823" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Voice of Breland—Boranel Cedes Western Reaches</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p198</span></span><p>In

filthy ogres and mangy gnolls, King Boranel's legendary courage has 
apparently faltered. We can only assume he means to yield to Cyre next.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>Thanks
 to the guidance of the hags, the diverse inhabitants of Droaam are 
learning to work together and finding ways to use their supernatural 
gifts to help build and sustain society. A medusa might use its 
petrifying gaze to preserve the life of an injured ally until medical 
attention can be obtained. Harpies in the taverns of Droaam use their 
hypnotic songs to entertain rather than to harm. When you bring 
creatures from Droaam into the campaign, consider how different monsters
 can work together in unusual ways and how their special abilities could
 be used outside combat.</p><p>Droaam offers a way to introduce monsters
 into any adventure, and for characters to encounter these monsters in 
untraditional ways. Droaam demonstrates that even monstrous creatures 
want the same things that members of other races do, more or less.</p><p>Droaamish
 monsters of a civilized bent could appear anywhere in Khorvaire. House 
Tharashk brokers the services of Droaamish monsters across the 
continent. Some of these monsters can appear in traditionally aggressive
 roles, as mercenary soldiers, a crime lord's bodyguards, or assassins 
in the shadows of Sharn. But Tharashk also provides less violent 
services. Ogre laborers put their strength to practical use in many of 
the continent's cities. Gargoyle couriers are in high demand. Though 
monstrous workers of these sorts are still rare in many nations, their 
numbers are growing.</p><p>Conversely, a visit to Droaam gives 
adventurers a chance to explore a land untethered by the laws of the 
treaty nations, a realm where they are the outsiders and the monsters 
are at home. Adventurers might have to pursue a fugitive or a war 
criminal into Droaam, or go there in search of unusual services or 
information found only in the land of monsters.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="824" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Warlords of Droaam</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p198</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Droaam

isolated enclaves: the medusa city of Cazhaak Draal, the harpy flights 
of the Byeshk Mountains, the scattered minotaur clans, the mysterious 
changeling city known as Lost. But other creatures have long been 
commingled. The ogres, orcs, trolls, hill giants, goblins, and kobolds 
of Droaam have never had distinct cultures; they have always been 
blended. Although enclaves made up of a single kind of creature do 
exist, most communities contain a mix of creatures.</p><p>In bygone 
days, many of these groups of creatures lived in transient communities, 
ruled by the most powerful among them and constantly in conflict with 
neighboring forces. When the Daughters of Sora Kell rose to power, they 
used force and persuasion to bring an end to this violence. They 
recognized the most powerful existing warlords as rulers of their 
domains, and they appointed lieutenants—including oni and other powerful
 and intelligent creatures—to govern other regions.</p><p>Within Droaam,
 any creature that commands the loyalty of a band and has successfully 
claimed and held territory can call itself a warlord, but only a small 
number of such leaders wield significant power. A few of the most 
notable warlords and factions are described below.</p><p><b>Cairngorm</b>.
 A remarkably intelligent gargoyle, Cairngorm is the lord of Grimstone 
Keep. He leads the largest host of gargoyles in Droaam, and Grimstone is
 also home to orcs and other creatures.</p><p><b>The Dark Pack</b>. An 
alliance of lycanthropes, worgs, and other bestial creatures is led by 
an elf werewolf named Zaeurl. The Dark Pack bears a deep hatred for 
followers of the Silver Flame.</p><p><b>Gorodan Ashlord</b>. A fire 
giant exiled from Xen'drik has earned the loyalty of a powerful force of
 ogres and hill giants. Gorodan knows a great deal about Xen'drik and 
could prove a valuable resource to adventurers.</p><p><b>Harpy Flights</b>.
 The harpies have long dwelled in the Byeshk Mountains. Several flights 
across the nation—including the Stormsinger, Last Dirge, and 
Rotwing—have pledged themselves to the Daughters of Sora Kell. Other 
flights remain in isolation in the mountains. The largest of these is 
the Wind Howlers, whose leader, Callain of the Bloody Word, despises the
 hags.</p><p><b>Kethelrax the Cunning</b>. The kobold lord Kethelrax has
 laid claim to Shaarat Kol in the south of Droaam and leads host of 
kobolds and goblins—creatures that have been traditionally enslaved and 
oppressed by the larger and more powerful inhabitants of the region. 
Though his epithet, "the Cunning," is used mockingly by other warlords, 
Kethelrax has the favor of Sora Katra and has proven to be clever in his
 own right. The kobolds are thrilled to have their own territory and are
 fiercely loyal to the Daughters, but many yearn for revenge against 
their former masters.</p><p><b>Rhesh Turakbar</b>. The minotaur warlord 
Rhesh Turakbar has united the small clans of his people into a deadly 
force. His fortress is on the eastern edge of Droaam, and he often leads
 raiding parties into Breland in the name of his fiendish patron, the 
Horned Prince—also known as <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rak%20tulkhesh_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="rak%20tulkhesh_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Rak Tulkhesh</a> (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>).</p><p><b>Sheshka, the Queen of Stone.</b>
 The medusas have long held the ancient citadel of Cazhaak Draal. Though
 they are not numerous, their deadly gaze and trained basilisk pets make
 the medusas a force to be reckoned with. Medusa priests of the Dark Six
 are spiritual leaders in many Droaamish communities. Queen Sheshka is a
 skilled warrior and general. She has been loyal to the Daughters, but 
she is devoted to her people and will always do what's best for them.</p><p><b>Tzaryan Rrac</b>.
 A cunning oni with a large force of ogres and orcs at his disposal, 
Tzaryan Rrac was quick to embrace the arrival of the hags, but he also 
yearns for greater power. Rrac is a skilled alchemist and a scholar of 
arcane lore.</p><p><b>Venom Lords</b>. A group of tieflings called the 
Venom Lords leads a community of warlocks, some of whom are also 
tieflings. Their domain, called the Venomous Demesne, is hidden away in 
the desolate marshes south of Blackwater Lake, shrouded by powerful 
magic. Warlord Bal Molesh is a strong ally of the Daughters, and some of
 his tiefling kin can be found in the service of Daask.</p><p><b>Xor'chylic</b>.
 A mind flayer serves as the governor of Graywall. It's said that the 
Daughters found Xor'chylic in Khyber, and received his loyalty in 
exchange for a pledge that the hags would give him an opportunity for 
vengeance against one of the daelkyr.</p><p><b>Znir Pact</b>. The gnolls of Droaam, once servants of <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rak%20tulkhesh_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="rak%20tulkhesh_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Rak Tulkhesh</a>,
 broke ties with the demons long ago and swore an oath of loyalty to the
 pack above all else. Since standing together and being bound by this 
Znir Pact, the gnolls have never been subjugated by any other force, and
 have never sought to conquer. Instead, they sell their services as 
hunters and soldiers, serving all warlords. The gnolls are trusted 
across Droaam.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="825" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Ruined Dhakaani Fort</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p199</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Ruined

It consists of four tiers in varying states of ruin.</p><p>The cellar, including a cistern and storage areas, is accessed by way of secret trap doors in the floor above.</p><p>The
 ground floor features a statue of a great hobgoblin hero of old in a 
large enclosed courtyard, and a cluster of unidentifiable statues in one
 back corner. The outermost area of the ground floor is the most 
severely damaged part of the fort.</p><p>The middle tower consists of 
two crumbling floors with arrow slits, accessed by spiral staircases 
from the ground level. The upper level of the tower has been severely 
damaged, with only old wooden planks and a rickety ladder allowing 
movement between the two floors.</p><p>The top level of the fort 
overhangs the tower. Large portions of the floor are missing, making 
certain areas difficult to reach. Arrow slits on the perimeter of this 
level made it instrumental to the fort's defense, and the large rooms 
here were used for arms storage and mustering troops for battle.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="827">

 Kell is an ancient night hag with exceptional powers. She is said to 
have dealt with dragons and demons in the first age of the world, and to
 have tricked the Sovereigns themselves. Even though she is immortal, 
there have been no new legends of her deeds since the advent of Galifar,
 but that's when her daughters rose to infamy. All three of the 
Daughters of Sora Kell possess powers far beyond what's usual for their 
kind. They are creatures of legend, beings who have defeated many of the
 greatest heroes of Galifar.</p><p>Sora Katra is the voice of the 
Daughters. Charismatic and clever, she is an accomplished illusionist 
and shapeshifter who rarely wears the same face twice. Stories say that 
she weaves curses on her loom, and that she loves to match wits with 
heroes and champions. She speaks for Droaam, and is always interested in
 intrigues and plots.</p><p>Sora Maenya is the commander of Droaam's 
armies. It's said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then 
eat the whole thing and still be hungry. She binds the souls of her 
victims to their skulls, which she keeps in her lair. Though many 
stories depict her as merely a brute, she is a clever strategist and a 
master of intimidation and terror.</p><p>Sora Teraza is a mystery. 
Though blind, or perhaps because of her blindness, she possesses vast 
powers of divination. She is the most gifted oracle of the age, but her 
answers are often cryptic, even when dealing with her sisters; she might
 give vital advice even to her enemies. There is little that can be 
hidden from Sora Teraza, but the question is always whether she'll share
 what she knows.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="832" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Daughters and the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p201</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Droaam
 emerged as a nation in the final decade of the Last War. King Boranel 
of Breland brokered an uneasy truce with Droaam, but the other nations 
of Khorvaire have refused to recognize the Daughters' sovereignty. Most 
leaders believe Droaam will soon collapse into chaos, or that Breland 
will gather its strength and crush the Daughters. Others think that 
either of those assumptions gravely underestimates the abilities of the 
Daughters and their subjects.</p><p>In the aftermath of the war, the 
fighting forces of Droaam have become a significant resource for other 
nations of Khorvaire. Gnolls, minotaurs, ogres, and other creatures have
 proven to be capable mercenaries and laborers, and the Daughters have 
worked with House Tharashk to make these resources available to the rest
 of Khorvaire. This exchange both puts gold into the Daughters' coffers,
 and spreads their eyes and ears throughout the wider world.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="833" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Daughters Campaign Themes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p201</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>When
 involving the Daughters of Sora Kell in your campaign, the first 
question you need to answer is: what are their goals for Droaam?</p><p>One
 possibility is that the Daughters believe in their nation—that it is 
important to them to unite the monsters of Droaam and to give their 
charges a voice in the world. In this case, the Daughters can be 
ultimately sympathetic figures. They are fighting against the fears and 
prejudices of the people of the Five Nations, and also the selfish 
ambitions of many of their own power-hungry warlords. Once the 
adventurers learn that the Daughters truly want peace and prosperity, 
they could become envoys of the Daughters in the Five Nations or help to
 fight their enemies in Droaam. A character of a monstrous race could 
even become a warlord of Droaam. Even if the adventurers don't work 
directly with the Daughters, they could have need of their assistance; 
Sora Teraza might hold the answer to a vital mystery, or the adventurers
 might need an artifact hidden in the vaults of the Great Crag.</p><p>If
 you'd rather use the Daughters as straightforward villains, they could 
be driven by a thirst for power or a desire to end humanity's dominance 
over Khorvaire. Sora Teraza's visions enable them to target enemies with
 unerring precision and reveal enemy plans before they are carried out. 
Can the adventurers find a way to deal with Sora Teraza and end this 
threat before the armies of Droaam and agents of Daask make their move?</p><p>A
 middle-of-the-road view is that the Daughters are motivated solely by 
Sora Teraza's visions. They have no interest in gaining power or in 
maintaining their kingdom; they are fulfilling their role in a story 
that is still unfolding, and once it's resolved, they will abandon their
 thrones and return to their hidden haunts. Can Droaam survive without 
the Daughters, or will the nation dissolve into chaos?</p><p>Whatever 
path you choose should also be reflected in the nature of the criminal 
organization Daask, described later in this chapter. Those monsters are 
agents of Sora Katra; how do their actions support her agenda? Are they 
seizing power on behalf of Droaam, or are they pursuing a more 
mysterious agenda?</p><p>As described in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4">chapter 1</a>,
 Sora Kell herself could be a group patron for a party of adventurers. 
In this case, the characters' relationship with the sisters is 
complicated. Do the Daughters consider the adventurers to be allies, or 
are they bitter rivals? Does Sora Kell support the nation of Droaam, or 
are the Daughters defying the wishes of their mother?</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="834" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Droaam Adventure Hooks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p201</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Any

 Gatekeepers are a druidic sect dedicated to protecting the natural 
world from unnatural forces. They battle aberrations and guard against 
extraplanar invasions and the release of ancient evils.</p><p>The 
Gatekeepers maintain the oldest druidic tradition on Khorvaire. Over 
fifteen thousand years ago, the green dragon Vvaraak came to the Shadow 
Marches and gathered a following from among the orcs of the region. In 
her studies of the Prophecy, Vvaraak had foreseen a great threat that 
could be stopped only by the younger races. So she taught the orcs the 
secret language of the natural world and showed them how to work with 
stone and soil, and how to read the future in the movement of the Ring 
of Siberys. She charged her students to remain ever vigilant against the
 threat that was to come, and to protect nature from those that would 
corrupt it.</p><p>Thousands of years later, the daelkyr (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>)
 opened gates from the plane of Xoriat and unleashed hordes of mind 
flayers, beholders, and other foul creatures into the world. The 
conflict that followed destroyed the goblin empire of Dhakaan, and the 
daelkyr's invasion left scars across Khorvaire. Ultimately, Vvaraak's 
students sealed the gates and imprisoned the daelkyr in Khyber. Even 
after this triumph, the orcs couldn't be sure if they had turned back 
the threat Vvaraak had foreseen, or if a greater danger lay ahead. So, 
in addition to guarding the seals that bind the daelkyr and keep Xoriat 
at bay, the Gatekeepers remained vigilant against the possibility of 
worse to come.</p><p>In the millennia since that struggle ended, the 
Gatekeepers have shared Vvaraak's wisdom and druidic magic with humans, 
shifters, and others who came to Khorvaire. New interpretations of 
Vvaraak's teachings gave birth to new druid sects: the Wardens of the 
Wood, the Greensingers, and the Ashbound. Today, the Gatekeepers are one
 of the smaller sects, and many of the sites of their long-ago battles 
have been abandoned and forgotten. But some Gatekeepers still remain in 
the Shadow Marches and the Eldeen Reaches, continuing their vigil to 
this day.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="837" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Gatekeepers in the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p202</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Last War had only minimal impact on the Gatekeepers, and vice versa. 
The druids' primary concern was to prevent military activity from 
disrupting the seals they guarded. Occasionally the Gatekeepers attacked
 groups of scouts or military patrols, driving them away to ensure that 
battles didn't erupt in their vicinity. Sometimes the Gatekeepers failed
 in those efforts, and Xoriat's corruption spread over some remote 
regions while the war raged around them.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="838" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gatekeeper Seal</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p202</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 seals forged by the Gatekeepers have a variety of purposes and forms. 
Some are tied to specific daelkyr, keeping those individuals bound in 
Khyber and stripping them of some of their powers. Others ward against 
aberrations in general, or suppress the influence of the plane of 
Xoriat. Some seals are amulets, objects that can be carried and stolen. 
It's said that one of the seals is a druidic bloodline, and it will last
 until the last member of the line is slain.</p><p>The most common form 
of Gatekeeper seal is a great stone slab set into the ground or a cavern
 wall. It is carved with mystical symbols that hedge out the influence

 4.4 shows what a Gatekeeper seal might look like. A seal is a protected
 site, usually attended at all times by Gatekeepers who live at or near 
the seal. The one depicted in the map lies on the edge of a swamp, but 
it could be located in any kind of terrain. A circle of standing stones 
serves to focus the magic of the area toward the seal itself, and the 
stones also serve as a place of worship for the druids' devotions and 
ceremonies.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="840">

 Gatekeepers are the remnants of an ancient order. Once they saved the 
world. Now they are all but forgotten, and the world needs saving again.
 The surviving Gatekeepers might not have the strength to win the fight 
alone, and that's where adventurers come in. Gatekeepers can serve as 
patrons or advisors, providing crucial information or setting the 
adventurers on the proper path. They can also come to the rescue of 
adventurers who are close to being overwhelmed by mind flayers or 
dolgaunts.</p><p>At certain points in a campaign, the Gatekeepers might 
seem to be villains. The druids' mission to protect their seals and to 
oppose the rise of aberrations is of the utmost importance. Anyone who 
threatens a seal or assists the machinations of the daelkyr, no matter 
how unwittingly, risks making relentless enemies in the Gatekeepers. A 
simple shift in circumstances, such as the death of a noble that causes 
ownership of a trackless parcel of land to change hands, could bring the
 characters into sudden conflict with the Gatekeepers.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="847" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gatekeeper Adventure Hooks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p204</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Gatekeepers can be at the center of any number of potential stories.

 drums are sounding in the depths beneath Darguun. Bugbear champions 
hone their adamantine greatswords, and hobgoblin dirge singers call the 
legions to battle. The warriors of Dhakaan are preparing to reclaim 
their stolen lands, and the nations of Khorvaire have no idea what's 
coming.</p><p>During the struggle with the daelkyr, some Dhakaani 
leaders saw the madness spreading among their people and knew it would 
destroy their civilization. They led their forces into deep subterranean
 chambers and severed all contact with the outside world. In recent 
years these ancient clans—who call themselves the Kech Dhakaan ("bearers
 of [the traditions of] Dhakaan")—have finally returned to the surface.</p><p>The
 Dhakaani are utterly devoted to war, matched only by the Valenar elves 
in their devotion to the martial arts. Their weaponsmiths and armorers 
know techniques that even the artificers of House Cannith cannot 
duplicate. Throughout the Last War, no nation faced any other force that
 had the skill and resources of the resurgent Dhakaani.</p><p>But there 
is one obstacle to their rise: the Heirs of Dhakaan have no emperor. The
 goblinoids are divided into clans, and each clan, or <i>kech</i>, 
believes its leader has the right to control all the others. And so the 
champions of Dhakaan continuously compete with each other to prove their
 right to rule. The Kech Sharaat (Bladebearers) believe that leadership 
is best achieved through force of arms. The Kech Volaar (Wordbearers) 
believe that knowledge is the greater weapon, and they seek to recover 
artifacts and weapons that were lost when the empire fell. These and 
several less influential clans are competing for overall leadership, 
while the spies and assassins of the Khesh'dar (Silent Folk) remain 
neutral in the struggle, gathering information on the modern world and 
serving every clan.</p><p>At the moment, the Heirs of Dhakaan are 
maintaining a low profile. They fight most of their battles underground,
 and occasionally dispatch small squads to carry out missions on the 
surface. Humans usually don't know enough about goblins to tell the 
difference between the Dhakaani and the people of Darguun. The truth of 
the matter is gradually spreading within Darguun, but no one yet 
realizes the power of the force that lies beneath their nation.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="850" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Heirs and the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p204</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Last War caused the Heirs of Dhakaan to finally stir and emerge from 
their deep vaults. They recognize that humanity has been weakened by its
 self-inflicted wounds. The rise of Darguun and the proliferation of 
that nation's Ghaal'dar mercenaries enables the Dhakaani to move around 
Khorvaire without drawing undue attention. And the Mourning, ultimately,
 demonstrated that the races of the Five Nations could not be trusted 
with ruling Khorvaire. It was time for the Dhakaani to return and 
subjugate the other races to their firm hand once again.</p><p>The Heirs
 of Dhakaan are devoted to war, with an unmatched focus on sheer martial
 skill. Their weaponry and artillery are of the highest quality, and 
they place their trust in strength of arms, not on magic. The Dhakaani 
don't worship gods, and no clerics or paladins are among them. The Kech 
Volaar have picked up some of the elven traditions of wizardry, and all 
clans have bards known as <i>duur'kala</i> (dirge singers), but in general the Dhakaani don't rely on magic on the battlefield.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="851" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Dhakaani Fort</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p205</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>All

 Heirs of Dhakaan are a substantial military threat. The goblins can 
clash with adventurers while they are exploring ancient ruins, or they 
can launch strikes against outposts or vaults the adventurers are 
guarding. Whatever the Dhakaani do, it should be part of a mission 
objective. Is the goal to strengthen their kech? Gather information 
about the enemy? Recover Dhakaani relics?</p><p>Initially the Dhakaani 
should be mysterious: remarkably skilled goblins that fight to the death
 or disappear into the shadows. The characters might logically assume 
that they are Darguul mercenaries. Over time, the adventurers should 
learn more about them and realize that they are the advance force of a 
great army.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan can remain an enigmatic foe, 
encountered only when they attack. But a group of adventurers could come
 to earn the respect of their Dhakaani foes and learn more about the 
enemy. Perhaps a group of adventurers chooses to respect the Dhakaani's 
claim to an artifact, surrendering it willingly. If they do so, they 
could find out more about the goblins and the struggle for leadership 
among the clans. Of all the goblins, the Kech Volaar are the most 
interested in understanding the people of Khorvaire; if there's any 
chance to negotiate a peace with Dhakaan, it would be with this clan.</p><p>As
 far as the goblins are concerned, humans stole their lands, pillaged 
their tombs, and enslaved their descendants. The Dhakaani aren't evil, 
but they believe humanity to be brutal and cruel, people without <i>muut</i> or <i>atcha</i>.
 Faced with an adventurer wielding a magic sword taken from a Dhakaani 
ruin, the Heirs of Dhakaan are rightfully angry and violent in their 
response to this tomb robber.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="857" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Heirs of Dhakaan Adventure Hooks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p206</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The Heirs of Dhakaan Adventure Hooks table offers some options for kicking off stories that involve the Dhakaani.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="858">Heirs of Dhakaan Adventure Hooks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 is still rising from the ashes of the Last War. The consequences of a 
century of conflict can't be offset with a single treaty. The Last War 
didn't end because people resolved their differences, and it didn't end 
with a victor. It ended when the Mourning destroyed Cyre, because people
 were afraid that the war itself was the cause of that cataclysm, and 
that continuing the struggle could doom them all. Many are sick of the 
endless conflict and embrace the peace. But just as many yearn to finish
 what their ancestors started, and others see potential profit for 
themselves in war. Some leaders focus on healing the lingering wounds of
 the conflict, while others work to ensure that their people will have 
an edge when fighting begins anew.</p><p>The Last War is one of the 
primary themes of Eberron. When developing an adventure in Khorvaire, 
consider how the lingering impact of the war could affect the story. 
Some element of the war could drive the entire adventure; the heroes 
could be tasked with recovering a relic lost in the war, or capturing a 
fugitive war criminal. But it can also be a background note that simply 
adds flavor to a story. If the adventure features a group of bandits, 
perhaps they're deserters, which can be all the more interesting if they
 once served in the army of the same nation as one of the player 
characters.</p><p>This section looks at the different ways that the Last War can influence an adventure.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="861" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Personal Impact</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p206</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>As
 players develop characters in an Eberron campaign, you can work with 
them to determine the role that the war played in their background. Here
 are a few topics for conversation:</p><p><b>Military Service</b>. Did 
the character fight in the war? If so, which nation did they serve and 
what role did they fill? If more than one of the characters fought in 
the war, did they serve together (or as allies) or fight on opposing 
sides? Military service can be the basis of a strong connection for two 
or more characters.</p><p><b>Civilian Life</b>. If the character is from
 one of the Five Nations and didn't fight in the war, how and why did 
they remain on the sidelines? Did they oppose the war? Did they do 
something to avoid conscription, or was there a reason they were 
considered unsuitable for service?</p><p><b>Personal Loss</b>. What did 
the characters lose during the war? Did members of their family die, and
 if so, how? Was the village they grew up in destroyed, and if so, who 
was responsible? If the characters are from Cyre, they have lost their 
nation. Do they have any loved ones left? Did they spend time in a 
refugee camp or in the outpost of New Cyre in Breland? Do they support 
Prince Oargev as the leader of Cyre, or do they have other ideas for the
 nation's future?</p><p>For example, when an Aundairan player character 
meets a group of Eldeen druids, it's an opportunity to exploit the bad 
blood between Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches and to determine if this 
interaction has any personal relevance to the character. If a player 
character has the soldier background, you can introduce an NPC as a 
former comrade and work out the details with the player on the spot. The
 Personal Impact table provides ideas for plot hooks that could directly
 involve a player character in a scenario.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="862">Personal Impact</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 shifted during the war, and almost every nation has grievances with 
every other one. Some of these postwar feuds rage more fiercely than 
others. One of these sources of tension could play a role in a 
character's back story, the plot of an adventure, or the reactions of an
 NPC. Although the nations are afraid to return to all-out war, any of 
these feuds could escalate.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="864" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p207</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Forty
 years ago, the farmers of western Aundair joined with the druids of the
 Towering Woods in seceding from the kingdom and founding the Eldeen 
Reaches. Most Aundairians consider this an unforgivable act of treason 
committed at a time of national weakness. The Reachers say their actions
 were precipitated by the neglect and corruption of the Aundairian 
nobles. Now that the war is over, many Aundairians believe Queen Aurala 
should reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="865" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Breland and Droaam</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p207</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Monstrous
 raiders from the western wilderness have plagued Breland for centuries.
 A decade ago, the Daughters of Sora Kell united the scattered warlords 
of the region under the flag of Droaam. Furious clashes erupted between 
Breland and Droaam, centering on the fortress of Orcbone and Brelish 
settlers in the west. Breland led the opposition to recognizing Droaam 
as a nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, and some Brelish believe 
King Boranel should take dramatic action to end this threat.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="866" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cyre and the World</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p208</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Cyrans
 maintain that they alone were in the right during the Last War, which 
began when the other nations refused to acknowledge the Cyran queen's 
rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Proud until the end, Cyre 
clashed with all the other nations. Now Cyre is destroyed, and Cyran 
refugees everywhere are dependent on the kindness of their former 
enemies. But many of those people believe that Cyre deserves no mercy, 
and that the refugees should be treated as enemy combatants rather than 
offered charity and compassion.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="867" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Karrnath and Thrane</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p208</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 enmity between these two nations runs far deeper and longer than what 
was wrought by the Last War. Thrane is the bastion of the Church of the 
Silver Flame, while Karrnath resorted to necromancy in the course of the
 war. Thranes accuse Karrns of being morally bankrupt; Karrns say that 
the Thranes are arrogant and naive. This long-standing rivalry led to 
intense conflict in the early days of the war, and it only grew worse. 
When Thrane became a theocracy, Karrns seized on this act as proof that 
the nation had abandoned the traditions of Galifar. When Karrnath 
integrated undead into its armies, Thrane swore it would never be at 
peace with those who would use such foul magic. Both nations have 
accepted the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, and the Karrnathi king 
has forsworn the creation of new undead soldiers, but the treaty has 
done nothing to ease the enmity between the two.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="868" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Thaliost</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p208</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 ancient city of Thaliost was once part of Aundair, and it has many 
proud ties to the history of that nation. It was seized by Thrane during
 the Last War, and the Treaty of Thronehold ratified its occupation of 
the place. Thrane placed an Aundairian archbishop, Solgar Dariznu, in 
charge of the city, and it has become a haven for Aundairian followers 
of the Silver Flame. But many of its citizens consider themselves to be 
Aundairians, and many prominent citizens of Aundair are putting great 
pressure on Queen Aurala to retake the city. The tension has been 
exacerbated by Archbishop Dariznu, who has taken brutal action to 
suppress Aundairian opposition to Thrane's occupation of the city.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="869" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Valenar</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p208</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 elves of Valenar have broken the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold on 
several occasions. They regularly antagonize their neighbors, raiding 
and provoking everyone in reach of their war bands; some independent war
 bands have even crossed the Talenta Plains to raid across the borders 
of Karrnath and Q'barra. High King Vadallia insists that these are the 
actions of individual soldiers, but he refuses to take action against 
the perpetrators. Some scholars believe Vadallia and the Valenar are 
trying to provoke a full-scale conflict—by the strictures of their 
religion they don't want to be conquerors, but they want a powerful 
enemy to attack their nation. If this hypothesis is true, they might 
continue to escalate their activity until Karrnath or another powerful 
nation is forced to react.</p><p>Though the Valenar regularly raid their
 neighbors, these attacks rarely target civilians. The elves aren't 
interested in wealth or territory; they are looking for challenging 
battles. They might attack military outposts, patrols, adventurers, or 
other brigands—any force that seems like it could put up a good fight.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="870" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Everyday Impact</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p208</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>There's
 no place in Khorvaire that escaped the Last War unscathed. Even 
villages that were never attacked lost their children to conscription or
 suffered from shortages. Some towns far from the front lines suffered 
damage from long-distance magic weapons or terror attacks. Any time you 
are setting a scene, you could add some element that speaks to the 
ongoing impact of the Last War. The Everyday Impact table offers some 
suggestions for these elements.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="871">Everyday Impact</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 one knows what caused the Mourning, and the fear of repeating this 
cataclysm—not the Treaty of Thronehold—is what keeps potential 
combatants at bay. No one is happy with the outcome of the war, but no 
one dares to continue fighting, since all believe that renewed 
full-scale conflict could result in utter destruction. That said, the 
general belief is that the mystery of the Mourning will eventually be 
solved. Either someone will learn how to control the power that caused 
the Mournland, or the precise cause will be determined and people will 
be able to tell if it still poses a threat.</p><p>Many people truly hope
 that the Last War will live up to its name forever. But others prepare 
for more war even as they pursue peace. First and foremost, every nation
 wants to unravel the mystery of the Mourning; a nation that could learn
 how to use this power would be unstoppable. Other forces are searching 
for weapons or forgotten powers that could turn the tide if another war 
breaks out. Adventurers could find themselves racing through ruins in 
Xen'drik, trying to destroy a weapon of the ancient giants before the 
Emerald Claw can claim it for Karrnath and <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#lady%20illmarrow_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="lady%20illmarrow_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Lady Illmarrow</a>.</p><p>The
 characters can stumble into a web of intrigue without seeing the sticky
 strands. Perhaps a patron hires the adventurers to transport what seems
 to be an ordinary backpack full of goods, and they don't realize that 
it has a secret magical compartment until enemy spies come looking for 
whatever is inside it. Or a dying spy presses an amulet into the hand of
 one of the adventurers, saying, "The fate of Breland depends on you 
getting this to Boranel. Don't trust anyone!" Assuming the adventurers 
care about the fate of Breland, they're pressed into an urgent adventure
 that has implications they might not see or understand.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="873" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Playing During the Last War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p209</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>In
 your campaign, you might want to take a look back at the war as it 
unfolds. Setting an adventure during the Last War puts the characters in
 a tumultuous time of political intrigue, tenuous alliances, and brutal 
conflicts. Consider these ways to make the Last War a present reality in
 your campaign:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">The players 
create new characters who live during a specific phase of the war. These
 characters could be figures of legend whose great deeds are known to 
the present-day characters, or they could be unknowns caught up in 
events much larger than themselves. In either case, the adventure they 
undertake can set the stage for events in the "present day" of your 
campaign.</li><li class="rd__li ">You might run an introductory session 
or flashback set during the waning years of the war, bringing the 
characters' backgrounds to life. Maybe the characters are all part of 
the same unit in the war, or they might be enemies forced to cooperate 
when disaster strikes. Are the characters participants in a memorable 
battle? Do they take actions they'll later regret? Do they make a bitter
 enemy who comes back to haunt them years later, when the campaign 
continues in the present day?</li><li class="rd__li ">A magical 
phenomenon might send the characters back in time, putting them in the 
middle of the conflict. Are they transported there to learn something? 
To alter the course of history? Or are they just stranded in a twisted 
time stream? How will they escape the horrors of the war and get back to
 their own time?</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="874" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Villains of the Last War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p209</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Just
 as adventurers are shaped by their experiences in the Last War, 
villains often carry the physical and mental scars of the conflict. When
 developing the details of a villain's background, consider the 
following options.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="875" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">War Criminal</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p209</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>What
 horrific actions did the villain take during the Last War? Did they 
massacre civilians? Betray their comrades or their nation? A brilliant 
artificer might have designed arcane weapons that violated the rules of 
engagement.

 could have overseen a camp where prisoners of war were used as subjects
 in necromantic experiments. Is the villain infamous for their crimes, 
or yet to be exposed for what they did? Do they believe that their 
crimes were justified? Is the criminal protected by powerful people in 
their nation, or reviled by the people they served?</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="876" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Grim Inspiration</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p209</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Something
 the villain saw or experienced during the war made a lasting impression
 that still drives them today. Perhaps their family was killed in a 
senseless attack, and everything they are doing is motivated by a desire
 to avenge this loss. Maybe they think that they were betrayed by their 
own nation. Perhaps they were caught in the Mourning, and even though 
they somehow survived it, what they lived through drove them insane.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="877" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Former Comrade</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p209</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 former comrade-in-arms can be a useful hook to draw adventurers into a 
story—or a compelling villain. Which one of the characters served 
alongside the villain? Were they equals, or was one of higher rank? Did 
the villain abandon or betray the adventurer, or was it the adventurer 
who betrayed the villain? This option can be especially interesting for a
 warforged villain; while searching for their own identity following the
 war, they have embraced a dark path. If you use this motif, it's 
important to develop the story in conjunction with the players whose 
characters are connected to the villain—either establishing crucial

 first meeting, the villain of an adventure might seem to be a person of
 honor, or at the least a hardscrabble survivor doing what they think is
 right after surviving the war. The villain might have experienced some 
of the same things in the war that the characters did, making it easy 
for the characters to understand the villain's point of view—or at least
 to harbor a sliver of doubt that makes them think twice before rushing 
to condemn the villain. The War-Torn Villains table suggests twists you

 outposts across Khorvaire serve a variety of purposes during and after 
the war: rest stops for platoons on the move, garrisons for inactive 
troops, armories where weapons are stored, staging points for scouts and
 rangers who keep an eye on nearby enemy movements, and defensive 
fortifications meant to protect passes, bridges, or other key strategic 
locations. In an adventure, virtually anything can happen in or around

 outpost, as shown on map 4.5, is a simple building holding barracks, 
officers' quarters, and storage areas encased within multiple rings of 
fortification. A normal approach to the inner compound involves passing 
through one of two gate houses (protected by arrow slits and murder 
holes), crossing an open courtyard (with more arrow slits and defenders 
on the rooftop above), passing through another small gate area, and 
traversing the training yard before finally reaching the lone entrance.</p><p>An
 enormous magic weapon akin to a ballista is mounted atop the outpost 
and supported by a massive stone column. Depending on the outpost, this 
weapon might launch ballista bolts with tremendous force and speed, 
expel surges of lightning, hurl fireballs, or otherwise send devastating
 munitions at approaching enemies.</p><p>A basement area is dedicated to
 storage, including holding cells to contain prisoners of war while they
 wait to be transported to dedicated prison camps.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="882">

 is a figure of terror and pain. But the warforged under his sway (and 
some objective observers of other races) believe that his rage is fueled
 by the injustice heaped upon the warforged after their creation. The 
warforged were treated as disposable soldiers, almost slaves, during the
 war, and the postwar arguments over what rights the warforged should be
 granted—as if fundamental rights were meant to be bestowed or withheld 
by political authorities—gave the warforged themselves no voice, as if 
they were still the property of their creators. <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">The Lord of Blades</a>'

 legitimate grievances, even if the proposed action is abhorrent.</p><p>Compared to the total number of warforged created and deployed in combat during the Last War, the followers of <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">the Lord of Blades</a>

 didn't appear in the world until after the Day of Mourning. Only he 
knows what his identity was before then, but many suppositions have been
 put forth. Some scholars say that he was originally a warforged named 
Bulwark, the personal bodyguard of King Boranel of Breland. Others 
believe that he was the last warforged to emerge from the creation 
forges at Eston, completed in the last moments before the Mourning.</p><p>Perhaps the most outlandish idea is that <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">the Lord of Blades</a>
 is not a true warforged at all. The first warforged were created by an 
artificer named Aaren d'Cannith, who became furious when the house used 
his invention to create weapons of war. Based on that knowledge, some 
believe Aaren transferred his consciousness into a warforged body so 
that he could personally seek vengeance for the wrongs done to his 
children.</p><p>In the years following the war, <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="the%20lord%20of%20blades_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">the Lord of Blades</a>
 is a force to be reckoned with. The warforged are some of the few

out and scour sites that were devastated in the Mourning to gather lost 
weapons and magic, all part of their preparations for full-scale war 
against the creatures of flesh.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="888" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Warforged Ossuary</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p212</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A

 all logic and reason, people in Breland continue to argue that the

while philosophical debates rage and street protests grow heated, 
warforged who inhabit the dead land of Cyre continue to fight as if the 
war had not ended, launching raids out of the "dead-gray mist" to the 
neighboring lands—including, of course, Thrane. Proclaiming allegiance

 entities spawned at the dawn of time still haunt Eberron. The cities 
raised by those ancient overlords are now only ashes, but the Lords of 
Dust still dream of restoring their primordial dominion. These fiends 
bide their time in an inconceivably long game, sparring with the dragons
 of Argonnessen as they manipulate events in order to fulfill the words 
of the Draconic Prophecy in a way that will bring them victory.</p><p>Though the Lords of Dust are mighty enough on their own, they serve greater masters known as the overlords (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>).
 Unfathomably powerful fiends, the overlords were bound at the end of 
the Age of Demons by the power of the Silver Flame, and an overlord can 
be released from this binding only if doing so can be made to fulfill 
the Draconic Prophecy. Every fiend spawned from Khyber owes fealty to 
one of these overlords.</p><p>In many ways the Lords of Dust are a 
reflection of the Chamber. Each group is trying to steer the fulfillment
 of the Prophecy to serve its own ends. The goal of the Lords of Dust is
 to release the overlords from their bindings and loose them upon 
Eberron in a new age of darkness. Despite this unified goal, the Lords 
of Dust operate as an alliance of like-minded cabals rather than a 
single monolithic organization. Each cabal serves its particular 
overlord above all others, and the conditions that release one overlord 
could actually contradict those that would free another.</p><p>Accomplished
 shapeshifters, the Lords of Dust have agents spread across Khorvaire. 
Some might wonder why, with all their talents, they haven't tried to 
conquer the world already. The reason is that they have no interest in 
ruling this world; they want to return it to the state of unnatural 
glory that existed before. Their only interest in humanoids races is in 
directing them and their affairs down the paths necessary to release 
their overlords; aside from that, dealing with mortals is a tedious 
chore.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="901" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Lords of Dust and the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p215</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Lords of Dust took part in the events of the Last War whenever they saw
 opportunities to further their dark version of the Prophecy. It remains
 difficult to identify what events might have been manipulated by one of
 these fiends, because their schemes take so long to play out. Far in 
the future, it might become apparent that a seeming victory for the 
forces of good, or a battle averted that spared hundreds from death was 
ultimately the first step in an overlord's release. (For instance, a 
soldier who was otherwise fated to die in the battle that was avoided 
goes on to tempt a good-hearted priest into becoming corrupted.)</p><p>In the years since the Thronehold Accords, the Lords of Dust continue on as they ever have, advancing one small step at a time.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="902" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Demon Ruin</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p215</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 entice cruel and selfish people to become warlocks, drawing mystical 
powers from their mistress. These activities won't release an overlord, 
but they help to sustain it.</p><p>To release an overlord, the Lords of 
Dust must ensure that the Prophecy unfolds along a specific path. Often,
 following this path requires specific mortals to do specific deeds. For
 example, one shred of the Prophecy could stipulate that King Boranel 
has to be killed by one of the characters. The Lords of Dust could 
easily kill Boranel themselves, but that wouldn't be sufficient to bring
 about the desired end; somehow, they'll have to trick the adventurer 
into doing it.</p><p>Because the Lords of Dust so often work through 
pawns and minions, it might take a while for adventurers to realize that
 an apparently unconnected series of encounters early in a campaign are 
actually all part of the complex schemes of the Lords of Dust. These 
fiends are so devious that it is often impossible to discern a pattern 
to their actions until their plans have come to fruition and the 
connections have finally been made clear. (You could retroactively 
decide that what you intended as unconnected encounters were all part of
 the plan from the beginning!)</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="911" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lords of Dust Adventure Hooks</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p217</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The Lords of Dust Adventure Hooks table presents some ways to get the characters into a fiendish adventure.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="912">Lords of Dust Adventure Hooks</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 Cyre shone more brightly than any of its sibling nations in the kingdom
 of Galifar. It was the center of the kingdom's wealth, a monument to 
its artistic and arcane achievements, and the site of great centers of 
learning where preeminent masters of magic, architecture, and artifice 
taught at the forefront of their craft. It was also the home of House 
Cannith and its massive foundries: some of them built on mountains or in
 mountains, some gracefully spanning canyons, and others erected in vast
 labyrinths deep underground.</p><p>Today, this region is a festering 
wound across Khorvaire. A wall of mist surrounds a land twisted into 
strange and terrible shapes. Cyre was once called the Jewel of Galifar. 
Now it is the Mournland.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="914" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Mourning</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p218</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>No
 one knows the reason for what happened on 20 Olarune 994 YK. Though it 
had been battered, Cyre stood defiant; Cyran soldiers had recently 
driven deep into Karrnathi territory and were holding their lines 
against the combined forces of Breland and Thrane.</p><p>And then it all came to an end.</p><p>Some
 say that the dead-gray mist began in Metrol, initially flowing out of 
the royal palaces of Vermishard. Others swear that the disaster began in
 the Cannith stronghold of Making. All that is known is that the mist 
swiftly spread across the kingdom, transforming the lands and creatures 
caught within it. Over a million people died in the Mourning, including 
nearly all of the inhabitants of central Cyre. The mist slowed its 
advance as it spread, and some of those in the borderlands heard of the 
disaster in time to flee. Others survived because they were already 
beyond the borders of Cyre; the mist stopped mere feet away from the 
camps of Cyran soldiers holding sections of the Brelish front. And 
though the vast majority of people caught in the Mourning died, 
thousands did survive. Most have no clear memory of the event, and 
there's no explanation for why they were spared. The superstitious say 
that these people are cursed, that anyone touched by the Mourning is now
 an agent of darkness. (See the book's <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,0">introduction</a> for further details on how the Mourning might have affected characters.)</p><p>In
 the days immediately following the Mourning, many assumed that the mist
 would continue to spread. Intense panic slowly turned to curiosity as 
it became clear that the border had stabilized. Over the last four 
years, people have ventured into the mist for many reasons. Some sought 
to plunder the abandoned treasures of the richest nation in Galifar. 
Others hoped to find lost loved ones, or some explanation for the 
disaster. Few of these explorers have returned, and those survivors all 
tell tales of a land twisted in unpredictable and inexplicable ways.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="915">

 become iridescent glass or semiliquid sludge. Trees in one place turned

 creatures were slain outright by the Mourning. Others were mutated as 
the land was transformed. Sometimes the result was an entirely new life 
form; any previously unseen monster could appear as a spawn of the 
Mourning. Other creatures retained a semblance of their original 
physiology while taking on some sort of alteration. The Monstrous 
Mutations table has options for altering existing monsters to reflect 
this phenomenon.</p><p>Most warforged were unaffected by the Mourning, 
and the race as a whole seems immune to many of the lingering effects 
that plague the Mournland.

 constitute the closest thing to a humanoid society that can be found in
 the Mournland. Similarly, golems and other constructs were largely 
unaffected by the Mourning.</p><p>The Mourning had no effect on existing
 undead, and a large number of new undead came into being when the 
cataclysm occurred. Various spirits (such as ghosts and specters) linger
 near the places where they died, and the corpses that litter an 
abandoned battlefield might rise up to continue fighting whenever a 
living creature comes near. Some of these entities are similar to undead
 that might be encountered outside the Mournland, but others have 
alterations that are tied to the unusual manner of their deaths. You can
 use the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,10,monstrous%20mutations,0">Monstrous Mutations table</a>
 to generate some details. Many of the mutations on this table might 
increase a creature's challenge rating by 1 or 2. Use the guidelines in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,9">chapter 9</a> of the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>
 to determine whether its challenge rating should increase and by how 
much, or you can simply increase it by 1 or 2 as you see fit.</p><p>Many
 Mournland creatures have mutations that are purely cosmetic and don't 
change their stat blocks. For example, one might have eyes that look 
like gemstones or might display glowing patterns on its skin or fur.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="925">Monstrous Mutations</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 catastrophe of the Mourning altered more than the landscape and living

 functions. In some places, magic barely functions, or certain magical 
functions are warped. In other places, spells persist past the instant

creatures.</p><p>A common misunderstanding about the Mournland is that 
healing spells refuse to work. The fact is that healing spells are 
impeded within the dead-gray mist, and occasionally in other areas, 
making it harder for someone to cast them effectively. Because so few 
expeditions make it far past the mist, the inability to heal is widely 
assumed to be a property of the Mournland as a whole.</p><p>The

 was the site of incessant battles during the Last War, from the first 
extended campaign—the siege of Eston in 895 YK—to the running battle on 
the Saerun Road that was cut short when the Mourning occurred. 
Battlefields across the Mournland, both ancient and recent, stand like 
open graves as evidence of the horrors of the war. In some places, 
armies that were fighting on the Day of Mourning became stone statues 
anchored in position. Others were crystallized or reduced to ash.</p><p>On
 the Field of Ruins—around the Saerun Road in the southwest part of the 
Mournland, where allied forces of Thrane and Breland battled an 
outnumbered Cyran army on the Day of Mourning—the fallen soldiers are 
preserved just as they fell, with no sign of rot or decay. Thousands 
upon thousands of corpses lie scattered across the field, facedown in 
the dirt or staring lifelessly at the gray sky. Even seasoned bands of 
treasure hunters are loath to enter the Field of Ruins.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="930" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Eston</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p221</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>House
 Cannith was born in Eston, and the house's labors transformed the city 
into a place of wonders. Clockwork birds perched and sang in silvery 
trees covered in steel bark. Skycoaches carried smiths and magewrights 
from forge to forge, and an iridescent dome protected the city from 
storms and harsh winds. On the proving grounds of the Cannith creation 
forges, cadres of newborn warforged learned the combat skills that would
 prepare them for active duty.</p><p>Eston began as a successful mining 
settlement, extracting iron and rare ores from the nearby hills. Drawing
 on these resources, the Cannith artificers in Eston spent decades 
researching all sorts of artificial creatures, which eventually gave 
rise to the warforged.</p><p>Because of these wonders, Eston is an 
irresistible attraction for treasure hunters hoping to access the vaults
 of House Cannith. Reports suggest, however, that it has become a 
strange and deadly place. It's said that the city is overrun by living 
spells. In addition to the remnants of damaging spells (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13,living%20spells,0">Living Spells</a>" in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>), there are stranger phenomena: living <i>continual flames</i> that crawl along the streets, cling to lampposts, and flee from strangers, and living <i>scrying</i> spells that shift and shimmer, displaying distant scenes on their amorphous skin.</p><p>Eston
 was renowned for its clockwork menagerie and its steel gardens, a 
showcase that chronicles House Cannith's centuries of work developing 
constructs and homunculi. These creatures have been twisted by the 
Mourning and have become deadly monsters. Stories tell of an enormous 
gorgon golem, of razor-winged swarms of silver songbirds, and many other
 equally strange things.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="931" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Making and the Glass Plateau</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p221</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Many
 people believe that the city of Making was at the epicenter of whatever
 caused the Mourning. The cataclysm reshaped the terrain around the 
city, creating the great highland formation known as the Glass Plateau.</p><p>The
 Glass Plateau is mostly smooth and flat, though jagged spikes and 
spires jut up from the ground in seemingly random places. The central 
portion of the highland plain is obsidian, and bursts of fiery light can
 sometimes be seen in its dark depths. Toward the edges of the plateau, 
the glass becomes lighter in color and more transparent, appearing 
almost pale white along the jagged cliffs at the edge. Nothing grows on 
the plain of glass, and few creatures haunt its jagged peaks and flat 
expanse.</p><p>The ruins of Making still peek through the obsidian flats
 of the Glass Plateau. Those who believe that the Mourning started here 
also expect that Making is where the mystery of its origin will be 
unraveled. A secret Cannith facility is supposed to lie in the city's 
subterranean depths.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="932" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Metrol</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p221</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>This

superficial damage; aside from the absence of people and the shroud of 
mist that hangs over the area, it looks much as it did before Cyre fell.

 weeks before the Day of Mourning, House Cannith unleashed its mightiest
 creations: the warforged colossi. Hundreds of feet tall, these 
gargantuan warriors thundered across Cyre, crushing everything in their 
path and leaving ruin in their wake. Meant to end the war decisively, 
these arcane war machines could pulverize soldiers beneath their feet 
and incinerate entire legions with beams of red light radiating from 
their mouths. But as the colossi were beginning to turn to the lands 
outside Cyre, the Mourning came, and the colossi perished. Now their 
remains lie, like mountains, in the Mournland, filled with secrets and 
waiting to be explored.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="942" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">History of the Colossi</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p223</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>House
 Cannith spent much of the war working on various kinds of constructs 
that could serve as soldiers, siege engines, or other weapons of war. 
Their earliest efforts, which lumbered onto Cyran battlefields in the 
late 930s YK, were barely more than golems with limited sentience, 
difficult to command in the field. The warforged titans were developed 
over the next twenty years, and the modern warforged—often perceived as 
the pinnacle of Cannith engineering—first saw battle in 965.</p><p>Successful
 as the warforged were, though, House Cannith never lost interest in 
building a better titan. Cyre didn't lose its desire for deadly weapons 
that could give it an edge over its enemies, and tremendous amounts of 
gold flowed from Cyre's coffers into the vaults of House Cannith as 
research and development continued, working toward a new kind of 
warforged that would bring an end to the war once and for all, and 
establish Cyre's martial supremacy for centuries to come.</p><p>With 
Cyre's immense wealth fueling its effort, House Cannith called upon the 
ingenuity of its best artificers and magewrights. Construction began on 
enormous new creation foundries, hundreds of feet tall, carved into the 
sides of mountains or secretly nestled within remote canyons.</p><p>The 
project succeeded beyond Cyre's wildest dreams. When the original 
warforged colossus took its first thunderous footsteps, it was met with a
 reaction of equal parts awe and horror—and it was almost immediately 
sent north toward Metrol, where armies from Karrnath were menacing the 
Cyran capital.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="943" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Operating a Colossus</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p223</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 warforged colossus is part warforged and part vehicle. It stands 
between 200 and 300 feet tall. For optimal performance, a colossus 
required an active crew including a captain with the Mark of Making, a 
weapons officer with the Mark of Storm, and a helmsman with the Mark of 
Passage. When absolutely necessary, though, the colossus could direct 
itself but at diminished power. A colossus also carried a sizable 
contingent of elite troops, who could ride in safety within the colossus
 while it crushed through enemy lines or smashed through a wall, then 
pour out through hatches once the colossus was in position.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="944" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Docent Network.</span></span> <p>Controlling
 a construct of such size proved to be a great challenge for the Cannith

throughout the body of the colossus. Docent nodes are modeled after the 
ancient <i>docents</i> found in Xen'drik (described in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12">chapter 5</a>), and though they lack the full sentience or functionality of a true <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#docent_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="docent_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">docent</a>,

 recovered from Xen'drik—the whole network fed information back to the 
operator. Several smaller "hubs" of the network gave other operators 
access to the relevant parts of that information and enabled them to 
control parts of the colossus as well. The techniques and tools used to

 arose as an order of militant knights within the nation of Karrnath 
fell into disgrace and became a shattered remnant. The Order of the 
Emerald Claw now operates as a collection of cells of fanatical 
warriors, necromancers, and spies. On the surface, its members seem to 
be driven by Karrnathi patriotism, and they purport to be adherents of 
the Blood of Vol. The most cursory investigation reveals that claim to 
be a facade.</p><p>The truth behind the Emerald Claw is that they serve the lich <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#lady%20illmarrow_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="lady%20illmarrow_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Lady Illmarrow</a>,
 and in her name they carry out acts of destruction, murder, and 
necromantic terrorism. They have been linked to the theft of powerful 
items imbued with necromancy magic, and they often employ vicious undead
 minions that make even other Karrns uncomfortable. Most worshipers of 
the Blood of Vol are quick to point out that they don't accept the 
order's claim to membership in their faith, and those true worshipers 
vehemently reject the Emerald Claw's violent fanaticism.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="955" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Emerald Claw and the War</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p225</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>During
 the Last War, Karrnath was forced to embrace the practice of necromancy
 to bolster the ranks of its army. At the same time, a number of 
chivalric orders were founded by devoted worshipers of the Blood of Vol.
 These groups included necromancers and bone knights that were trained 
to raise and command the undead troops used during the war. The Order of
 the Emerald Claw was one of the most infamous of these groups, renowned
 for its fighting skills but often sanctioned for its brutal treatment 
of enemy soldiers. The Emerald Claw were also accused of slaughtering 
civilians so they could be raised as skeletons or zombies—behavior that 
was strictly forbidden by the Karrnath commanders.</p><p>When King Kaius
 III came to power near the end of the war, he turned against the Blood 
of Vol. The orders were disbanded, and many members of the Emerald Claw 
were condemned as war criminals. While the other orders complied with 
the king's edict, many knights of the Emerald Claw refused to surrender.
 The order fragmented as its original members scattered, but a number of
 those rebellious knights started their own cells, rallying all who 
wanted to see Karrnath achieve its rightful glory. The order experienced
 a surge in membership following the Treaty of Thronehold because many 
Karrns thought that Kaius III had betrayed their nation by embracing 
peace.</p><p>Six years ago, shortly after Kaius's accession, a figure known as <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#lady%20illmarrow_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="lady%20illmarrow_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Lady Illmarrow</a>
 emerged as the leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Few of her 
followers know anything about her, other than her great skill as a 
necromancer; many members of the Order refer to her as Queen of the 
Dead. Some members of the order believe she will ultimately raise 
Karrnath above all other nations. Others simply trust that she will 
grant them personal power. They believe that she is poised to become a 
god of death, and that when she ascends to divinity, they will be 
granted immortality or at least the eternal life of undeath.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="956" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Library Vault</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p226</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Map

 At the same time, it is fundamentally apart from the rest of the Great 
Wheel, sealed off from the other planes even while it's encircled by its
 own wheeling cosmology. Eberron's unique station in the multiverse is 
an important aspect of the world: its planes have profound and shifting 
influences on the Material Plane, and it is sheltered from the 
influences and machinations of gods and other powers elsewhere on the 
Great Wheel.</p><p>The planet of Eberron is the heart of its own 
Material Plane. It is surrounded by the Ring of Siberys. Beyond this 
band of dragonshards, twelve moons orbit the world. To date, no creature
 from Eberron has explored the moons, and none can say whether they are 
lifeless rocks or thriving worlds. Some sages believe that the moons are
 connected to the planes, or that they might even be physical extensions
 of the planes, but the truth of these assertions remains unknown.</p><p>No
 other planets have been discovered within Eberron's Material Plane. The
 underworld of Khyber, however, contains a host of demiplanes, tiny 
pockets of altered reality. As such, venturing beneath the surface of 
Eberron can lead you to a network of caverns and passages, and if you 
find the right passage, it can take you to fantastic and deadly places 
inhabited by fiends, aberrations, and other children of Khyber.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="968">

these have aspects of both Outer Planes and Inner Planes. All of them 
overlap with Eberron in some way, and they influence and are influenced 
by the Material Plane. The intensity of this influence waxes and wanes; 
scholars often depict the planes as orbiting Eberron—sometimes coming 
close, other times far away—though this manner of expression is merely a
 metaphor for their shifting influence. When another plane's influence 
on the Material Plane is especially strong, the plane is said to be 
coterminous. When its influence is weak, a plane is remote. The state of
 a plane can be important for performing epic rituals, creating of 
eldritch machines, or interacting with extraplanar entities. Whether or 
not a plane is remote or coterminous at a given time depends entirely on
 the needs of your story.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="971" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Manifest Zones</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p229</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>At

city of Sharn is located in a manifest zone linked to Syrania that keeps
 its towers reaching toward the sky and aids flight. Ghosts might linger
 in a manifest zone associated with Dolurrh, while a manifest zone tied 
to Lamannia might have wild vegetation and enhance druidic magic. A 
manifest zone might include a portal that allows free passage from 
either plane to the other. The descriptions of other planes in this 
section offer some other possible effects. Most manifest zones have 
reliable, persistent effects. Some have only weak connections to their 
planes, and their properties influence the world only when the plane is 
coterminous.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="972" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tour of the Planes</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p229</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Each

Material Plane, and no manifest zones are tied to Dal Quor. The only way
 to reach Dal Quor from the Material Plane is through the psychic

 is theoretically possible to travel between Eberron and other worlds in
 the multiverse by means of the Deep Ethereal or various spells designed
 for planar travel, but the cosmology of Eberron is specifically 
designed to prevent such travel, to keep the world hidden away from the 
meddling of gods, celestials, and fiends from beyond.</p><p>The three 
progenitor wyrms worked together to form Eberron and its planes as a new
 cosmic system in the depths of the Ethereal Plane. They recreated the 
elves, orcs, dragons, and other races found throughout the multiverse 
and placed them in their new world, but allowed them to develop beyond 
the reach of Gruumsh, Corellon, Lolth, and other influences for good and
 ill.</p><p>In your campaign, you might decide that the barrier formed 
by the Ring of Siberys is intact, and contact between Eberron and the 
worlds and planes beyond its cosmology is impossible. This is the 
default assumption of this book. On the other hand, you might want to 
incorporate elements from other realms. Perhaps you want to use a 
published adventure that involves Tiamat or the forces of the Abyss 
meddling in the affairs of the world. In such a case, it could be that 
the protection offered by the Ring of Siberys has begun to fail. You 
might link the weakening of Siberys to the Mourning—perhaps whatever 
magical catastrophe caused the Mourning also disrupted the Ring of 
Siberys, or perhaps a disruption of the Ring of Siberys actually caused 
the Mourning!</p><p>If contact between Eberron and the wider multiverse 
is recent and limited, consider the implications for everyone involved. 
In the Great Wheel, Asmodeus is an ancient threat, with well-established
 cults, lines of tieflings, and a long history of meddling that sages 
might uncover in dusty old tomes hidden in remote libraries. But if 
Asmodeus has only just discovered Eberron and begun to influence it for 
the first time, there is no lore about him to be discovered on Eberron. 
He has no power base and needs to recruit new followers. Unusual 
alliances might form against him, as celestials and fiends join forces 
to expel this hostile outsider.</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="999" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Gods, Celestials, and Fiends</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p232</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

Silver Flame, its power is always with you. The Sovereign Onatar guides 
the hand of every smith who knows how to listen for his voice, and Dol 
Arrah and Dol Dorn are active on every battlefield, guiding every 
soldier. This outlook means that religion is driven by faith, as opposed
 to the concrete actions of deities. The faithful believe that their 
triumphs reflect the assistance of a divine influence. They don't expect
 a god to physically show up and solve their problems.</p><p>Fiends and 
celestials certainly do have physical form, however. Fortunately for the
 folk of the Material Plane, these extraplanar creatures are deeply 
invested in their own affairs and have little interest in Eberron. 
Demons and angels battle one another in Shavarath, but they've been 
doing this since before humanity existed, and they dare not leave their 
posts to fool around elsewhere. Exceptions do exist, such as the daelkyr
 and the Dreaming Dark, but by and large these natives of other planes 
are exclusively concerned with where they live. As such, player 
characters are more likely to encounter celestials and fiends that are 
native to Eberron, spawned by Khyber or Siberys, rather than extraplanar

 Another—Bel Shalor, the Shadow in the Flame—is bound within the Silver 
Flame itself in the great cathedral in Flamekeep in Thrane. You can 
adapt other evil gods or archfiends for an Eberron campaign (assuming 
you don't want Eberron to be connected to the wider multiverse) by 
recasting them as overlords. For example, Tiamat could be an overlord 
embodying the pride and potential for evil within dragons, Lolth could 
be an overlord who preys on the elves, and Asmodeus the insidious maker 
of profane bargains.</p><p>Any fiend—whether devil, demon, yugoloth, or 
something else—could be spawned by Khyber if it suits your story. Such 
fiends might be bound to an overlord, or they might be independent

 ago, gnome artificers and specialists from House Cannith discovered and
 developed a means of magical travel. The heart of the process is a set 
of techniques for binding elementals that uses Khyber dragonshards. This
 closely guarded procedure requires delicate engineering, arcane skill, 
and rare materials from around the world, and different workshops employ
 varying esoteric techniques. Building a new vehicle can occupy a 
workshop for months while magical energy is painstakingly inlaid into 
the vessel's hull. Such work is a complicated task requiring the labor 
of many; it is not something that can be undertaken by a lone wizard for
 any amount of compensation.</p><p>The construction of elemental vessels
 requires the use of two kinds of dragonshards. A Khyber dragonshard of 
the largest size and finest quality is required to bind the elemental to
 the vessel, and a Siberys dragonshard is needed to craft the vehicle's 
helm. Production of new vessels grinds to a halt without a steady supply
 of both kinds of dragonshards, and a workshop with an order to fill 
will pay a handsome fee to adventurers who can find them.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1006" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Elemental Matrix</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p233</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Every elemental vessel is imbued with an <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#invisible_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="invisible_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">invisible</a>,
 arcane matrix. This magical essence extends from the containment 
chamber at the core of the vehicle to the binding struts, then through 
the rest of the vehicle's hull. When a Khyber dragonshard holding a 
bound elemental is placed in the containment chamber, the matrix comes 
alive. The unsuppressed elemental emerges from the shard and flows along
 the matrix in the way that blood moves through the arteries and veins 
of a living creature.</p><p>The binding struts force the elemental into a
 ring shape and give every elemental vessel its distinctive appearance. 
From there, the elemental continues to flow along the matrix through the
 hull, appearing as jagged, snaking lines of living energy that pulse 
and shift. These conduits of elemental energy take on an appearance 
associated with the type of elemental bound into the vessel. A fire 
elemental, for example, sends tendrils of flame along the hull of its 
ship.</p><p>At the command of the vehicle's dragonmarked pilot, the 
bound elemental can be suppressed, causing its essence to flow back into
 the containment chamber and the matrix to disappear from view. A 
vehicle whose elemental is suppressed ceases to be propelled.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1007" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Controlling the Elemental</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p234</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Piloting
 an elemental vessel requires effective communication between the pilot 
and the bound elemental. The elemental controls the vehicle's movement, 
and everything from basic propulsion to delicate maneuvering is 
dependent on the ability of the pilot to control the elemental. If the 
elemental is uncontrolled and not suppressed, the vehicle moves 
according to the elemental's whim until a pilot asserts control again.</p><p>A
 dragonmarked heir at the helm of a vessel can command the elemental 
easily. Without such a pilot, it's very difficult to control the vessel.
 A character who is touching either the Khyber dragonshard where the 
bound elemental is housed or the magic item at the vessel's helm can try
 to communicate with the elemental, but with no guarantee of success.</p><p>A character can make a DC 20 Charisma (<span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="persuasion_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Persuasion</span> or <span class="help help--hover" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="skill" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="intimidation_phb" data-vet-is-faux-page="true" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Intimidation</span>)

 airship is the most advanced elemental-powered vehicle on Eberron, the 
pride of House Lyrandar and the forerunner of the magical advances that 
many hope will become commonplace in the aftermath of the Last War. The 
first airships emerged from the Cannith and Zilargo workshops and 
appeared in House Lyrandar's service just eight years ago (in 990 YK). 
For now, though, they remain rare, because the soarwood required for 
their construction is exceedingly scarce and tightly controlled.</p><p>Soarwood
 is a form of buoyant timber found only on the island of Aerenal, and 
the elves who live there limit their annual harvest of the precious 
wood. As a result, production of new airships proceeds at a snail's 
pace, unable to satisfy the fervent demand for new vessels. The 
discovery of a new supply of soarwood could literally change the world, 
and even convincing the elves of Aerenal to part with more of it would 
be an achievement worth a handsome reward from House Lyrandar.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1010" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">How It Works</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p234</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 standard airship (at least as far as standards have been defined for 
this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship but is
 rigged with control fins and rudders rather than sails. An air or fire 
elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, which is suspended on 
four struts jutting outward. Most airships are outfitted with the finest
 amenities, including many decorative flourishes and creature comforts.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1011" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Operation.</span></span> <p>A dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar must pilot a Lyrandar airship, channeling the power of the Mark of Storm through the <a href="https://5e.tools/items.html#wheel%20of%20wind%20and%20water_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="items.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="wheel%20of%20wind%20and%20water_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">wheel of wind and water</a>
 that controls the vessel. The helm is typically situated near the rear 
of the ship, inside the shelter of a wheelhouse. Controlling the vessel 
(without the benefit of something like the <i>conductor stones</i> that dictate a lightning rail route) requires constant attention, so at least two pilots typically travel on every journey.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>Only
 a dragonmark heir with the Mark of Storm can use the wheel and command 
the bound elemental. House Lyrandar pilots train for months to gain a 
deep understanding of the ship's powers and limitations. Because of this
 training, a skilled pilot can execute acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.</p><p>Airships
 can move in all three dimensions, with or without the aid of the wind. 
Unlike most flying creatures, they don't rely on wings for lift thanks 
to their soarwood hulls. They are able to fly equally well on their 
sides or even upside down (notwithstanding the risks that such maneuvers
 present to passengers and crew).</p><p>Airships cannot actually land, 
because the struts that hold the elemental ring in place protrude 10 
feet from the bottom of the vessel. Thus, passengers and cargo are 
lifted in elevators and loaded at towers in major cities. Each ship 
carries rope ladders for use at smaller stations, in open terrain, or in
 cases of dire emergency.</p><p>A typical airship can reach a speed of 
20 miles per hour in clear skies carrying up to 30 tons of cargo. 
Airships are most often employed by explorers and by wealthy travelers 
who demand luxury—clients who have a need to move quickly to places that
 might not be served by the lightning rail.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1012" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Suppression.</span></span> <p>Although
 the elemental bound to the airship is essential for propulsion, the 
vessel's soarwood hull provides its lighter-than-air buoyancy. When the 
elemental is suppressed, the ship remains aloft but can't move. The 
pilot always suppresses the elemental before docking, then uses ropes to
 maneuver the vessel into position.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

 wondrous lightning rail system once linked the far reaches of the 
Kingdom of Galifar, prior to the Last War. Now the system is divided, 
split into eastern and western circuits. Reestablishing the <i>conductor stone</i>
 paths across Scions Sound and the Mournland is often discussed in the 
halls of power in the Five Nations, but formidable challenges are 
involved.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1015" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">How It Works</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p235</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A
 lightning rail train is made up of an elemental vessel linked to a 
series of connected carts, all of which float about 5 feet off the 
ground. Each cart, similar in form to a large wagon with no wheels, has a
 <i>conductor stone</i> embedded in its underside. A corresponding set of <i>conductor stones</i>
 laid out in a line on the ground interacts with the stones in the carts
 to form a rail for the train to follow. Lightning arcs between the two 
sets of stones, accounting for the system's name.</p><p>The elemental 
vessel at the front of the train, called a crew cart, holds a bound air 
elemental that propels the train along its route at a speed of about 30 
miles per hour. The elemental appears as a ring of lightning encircling 
the crew cart while the train is in motion. A bound air elemental can 
move a train of up to ten carts without obvious strain, and most trains 
are configured accordingly.</p><p>The other carts that make up the train
 have various purposes. A typical train has a crew cart at each end, 
with two cargo carts, four passenger carts, and two lounge carts in 
between. Doors at both ends of each cart enable crew and passengers to 
walk from one to the next, even while the train is in motion. Both crew 
carts are identical, except that the bound elemental in one is 
suppressed. On the return trip, the roles of the carts and the states of
 their elementals are reversed.</p><p>Specialized carts of other sorts 
vary in configuration depending on their purpose and the degree of 
luxury afforded to them. Some have solid sides and roofs, while others 
are covered only with canvas.</p><p>Map 4.10 shows the different carts that comprise most lightning rail trains.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1016" data-title-relative-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Operation.</span></span> <p>The
 vessel's pilot, a House Orien dragonmarked heir, stands at the helm, 
high atop the crew cart, beneath the elemental binding struts. The pilot
 controls the elemental and communicates with it during the trip, 
watching the path ahead through broad windows that encircle the helm 
platform.</p><div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div><p>The placement of <i>conductor stone</i>
 lines dictates where a lightning rail train can travel, but the pilot 
still must make operational decisions as the coach moves from one city 
to the next. The pilot controls the vessel's speed based on conditions 
around the train. When <i>conductor stone</i> lines split, as they do at
 various hubs along the way, the pilot selects the intended route and 
directs the elemental down the correct line.</p><p>The crew of a train 
includes handful of chief stewards overseeing a number of lesser 
stewards who are charged with seeing to the needs of passengers and 
keeping cargo secured.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="1017">

 rail stations, where passengers and cargo can be disembarked or loaded,
 are located in or just outside villages, towns, and cities along the 
conductor stone paths. There are no stations in the expanses between 
these settlements, and House Orien rules prohibit lightning rail pilots 
from stopping anywhere but at a station.</p><p>Stations throughout 
Khorvaire have a similar look and feel, to ensure that each one lives up
 to the high expectations of House Orien's patrons. White and gold <i>everbright lanterns</i>
 continually illuminate each station. When a train pulls into the 
station, loading ramps are moved into position beside each cargo cart, 
and stairs by each passenger cart. The cargo is unloaded from one side 
of the train and the passengers from the other.</p><p>Individual 
stations do have distinct touches that reflect local features. For 
example, the station in Gatherhold, in the Talenta Plains, is decorated 
with traditional halfling motifs and offers specialized stables for 
travelers leaving their dinosaurs behind. On a larger scale, the station
 at Passage, which is the seat of power for House Orien, is a 
multistoried structure designed as a monument to the majesty and storied
 history of the house.</p></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1020" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Mysterious Passengers</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p238</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Lightning

 and explorers making their way across Khorvaire, especially in 
out-of-the-way areas, often find themselves in need of a safe place to 
spend the night. Thanks to the efforts of House Ghallanda, there's no 
better place to take a rest than at one of the hundreds of Gold Dragon 
Inns that the house operates.</p><p>Every city, most towns, and even 
some villages have a Gold Dragon Inn, and a large city might boast 
several. Every major road through the countryside has Gold Dragon Inns 
along much of its length, spaced roughly a day's travel apart. Sometimes
 an inn is the nucleus of a small community whose industry is focused on
 providing for the needs of travelers. A few Gold Dragon Inns are found 
in locations that offer no other comforts for the weary traveler—for 
example, high in a pass through the Byeshk Mountains, deep in the 
Karrnwood, or beneath the surface of the Mror Holds.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1023" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Inn Features and Amenities</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p239</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Every
 Gold Dragon Inn provides a standard menu of reliable services at 
reasonable rates. Prices are fixed (equal to those given in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,4">chapter 5</a> of the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>),
 and the quality of services is reliably modest, with some comfortable 
upgrades available. Every inn uses one of a small number of possible 
floor plans, and every inn's restaurant offers the same menu.</p><p>The 
size and number of guest rooms can vary from inn to inn: a small 
roadside inn has four rooms and a moderately sized common room, while a 
thriving inn in a large city has forty rooms, a restaurant, and a 
separate common room, with two stages for entertainment. Because the 
inns are owned by House Ghallanda, the buildings all include 
accommodations for halfling-sized guests as well as taller folk.</p><p>Because travelers often carry valuables with them, each inn has a heavy strongbox secured with an <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#arcane%20lock_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="arcane%20lock_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">arcane lock</a>
 spell. To make a traveler's stay more enjoyable, perhaps even 
memorable, House Ghallanda has arranged with House Thuranni and House 
Phiarlan to employ guild-licensed entertainers at almost every Gold 
Dragon Inn.</p><p>To populate an inn with some distinctive individuals, you can use the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,10,mysterious%20passengers,0">Mysterious Passengers table</a>.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1024" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Inn Attractions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p239</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The Inn Attractions table offers some ideas for unique twists on an inn's character or atmosphere.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1025">Inn Attractions</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 3 describes the city of Sharn in detail; the following sections focus 
on the adventures that can happen there. These adventures can unfold 
among the tallest towers of Skyway, in the deepest depths of the Cogs, 
or anywhere in between. At the end of this chapter is an introductory 
adventure, "<a href="https://5e.tools/adventure.html#EFR,0">Forgotten Relics</a>," set in Sharn.</p><p>Sharn
 can be a grim place that makes good people bad and bad people worse. In
 its mean streets, gritty detectives contend with corrupt law officers 
while trying to foil the efforts of merciless gangs and monstrous thugs.
 In the highest towers, wealthy barons from the dragonmarked houses make
 shady deals with crime bosses, each of them making profits by 
exploiting both the ordinary folk and the well-heeled upper crust alike.
 Corruption can be found among the ranks of government, the watch, the 
temples, and large businesses. This atmosphere makes Sharn a perfect 
location for adventures inspired by the noir genre.</p><p>Sharn can also
 be a place of unrelenting action, ranging from soarsleds speeding 
between the towertops to confrontations in the dungeon depths far 
beneath the city's lowest tier. Fallen angels, sinister shapeshifters, 
and monstrous mercenaries do battle with heroes from all walks of life, 
while unscrupulous collectors and smugglers carry on a brisk trade in 
artifacts brought back from the cyclopean ruins of Xen'drik. All these 
factors make Sharn an equally ideal location for adventures inspired by 
pulp action.</p><p>You can use the Life in the City table to generate ideas for adventures set in Sharn.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1028">Life in the City</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 you're creating a campaign based in Sharn, it's a good idea to 
establish a location that serves as a home base for the adventurers. You
 can use the Home Base table as a source of inspiration, or you can 
develop a unique location.</p><p>Work with the players to develop the 
connections that each character has to the site. If the location is a 
tavern, for instance, a bard character might perform there two nights a 
week. A fighter could be a regular who has a drink named after them. A 
ranger could be the undefeated champion of the local darts league. If 
the players enjoy this creative exercise, you could also allow each 
player to add a physical detail to the place or to describe one of the 
location's NPCs—the stuffed gorgon head over the hearth, another regular
 among the customers, and so on. This is a way to make this location 
truly feel like home, and to give each player a personal investment in 
it. This location becomes an automatic starting point for adventures, 
the place where the adventurers will meet with patrons and conduct 
business.</p><p>The Home Base table can also be useful to determine the venue if a patron wants to set up a meeting at a neutral location.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1030" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">The Streets of Sharn</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p240</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The Street Events tables starting with "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,11,lower%20sharn%20street%20events,0">Lower Sharn Street Events</a>"
 are filled with random events the characters can witness while they 
wander around Sharn. You can expand on an entry to make it the start of 
an encounter or adventure, though not every event needs to draw the 
characters into a longer story. Each table is meant to be used on a 
different level of Sharn: the lower wards, middle wards, upper wards, 
and Skyway. You can choose results from the tables, or randomly 
determine what happens, and you can modify results as you please, 
tailoring the details of an event to be a better fit for a particular 
district. The events on the tables are phrased so they can be read aloud
 or summarized to players.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1031" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">What Happens Next?</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p240</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>After
 the adventurers witness an event on the streets of Sharn, what happens 
next depends largely on what they do. Maybe they avert their eyes and 
keep walking, as many residents of Sharn have trained themselves to do. 
Maybe they rush to get involved, or poke around delicately to learn 
more. An event like one of these doesn't have to be the start of an 
adventure, but it can be—particularly if it really catches your players'
 imagination.</p><p>When the players decide to learn more, it's up to you to figure out what they can discover. Ask yourself these questions:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">How

 4.11 shows a typical Sharn location that contains intersections of 
bridges and platforms. Each bridge is 20 feet higher (on average) than 
the one immediately below it.</p><p>The bridges are connected to 
businesses and residences. The residences are usually locked, while most
 shops lock up at night. The taverns and gambling dens are open for 
business all day and well into the night. One of the bridges connects to
 a skycoach parking station, which houses several of those vehicles. 
Other bridges lead to an elevator, garden overlooks, and staircases that
 take pedestrians farther up and down into the city.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="1038">

 is part of everyday life in Sharn, and just as in any other city, 
sometimes such acts are carried out by people who have no ties to 
organized crime. An upstanding citizen could be driven to murder by 
passion. A refugee could become a cutpurse out of desperation. The rowdy
 Brelish veterans who call themselves the Brokenbridge Brawlers don't 
think of themselves as criminals, and they have no connection to any 
larger organization.</p><p>Any professional criminal in Sharn, however, 
is likely to be affiliated with one of four organizations. The Boromar 
Clan is the most entrenched and widespread of the four, and has 
dominated the business of crime in Sharn for centuries. The group called
 Daask is on the rise, directly challenging the Boromars. The Tyrants 
and House Tarkanan are smaller organizations with more specialized areas
 of operation. These groups are summarized in the Criminal Organizations
 of Sharn table and described in the later sections that follow.</p><p>Each
 of these organizations has a core of operatives and enterprises under 
the direct control of its leaders. But each also has a network of 
secondary relationships.</p><p>For example, the Little Fingers are a 
group of pickpockets and cutpurses that work in the Bazaar of Middle 
Dura. They aren't directly tied to the Boromar family. But the master of
 the gang pays a tithe to the Boromars, and if the Boromars send word to
 them that certain targets are to be avoided, the Little Fingers do so. 
In return, the Boromars ensure that the Sharn Watch in Middle Dura 
largely leaves the Fingers alone. So although the Boromar Clan itself 
has a few hundred members, it has interaction with thousands of 
criminals throughout the city.</p><p><a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,8">Chapter 3</a>
 provides an overview of the four major criminal organizations and a 
body of information about them that's more or less common knowledge in 
Sharn. This section explores the roles that each one could play in a 
Sharn-based campaign.</p><p>Although the powerful organizations in Sharn
 have a hand in most criminal activity, sometimes you might want an 
adventure to involve a smaller gang. The Street Gangs table presents a 
number of lesser criminal groups adventurers could tangle with.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="1043" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">Narcotics in Sharn</h4><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p244</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></span><p>From
 the owners of incense-clouded dens to fast-talking street dealers, many
 entrepreneurs—legitimate and otherwise—make a profitable business 
selling narcotics in Sharn. The following drugs are just two of the most
 notorious substances available in the City of Towers and beyond.</p><p><b>Dragon's Blood</b>.
 Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon's blood is a potent and highly 
addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance 
spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability 
to cast sorcerer spells. The drug's effects are potentially dangerous 
and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should
 want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask 
smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#fireball_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="fireball_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">fireball</a> in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the <a href="https://5e.tools/tables.html#wild%20magic%20surge_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="tables.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="wild%20magic%20surge_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Wild Magic Surge</a> table in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>.</p><p><b>Dreamlily</b>.
 A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite 
beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to 
help manage pain during the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused 
substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn't illegal if used for medicinal
 purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in 
and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the 
lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings
 about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of 
dreamlily is <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#poisoned_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="poisoned_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">poisoned</a> for 1 hour. While <a href="https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#poisoned_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="conditionsdiseases.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="poisoned_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">poisoned</a>
 in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it 
drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit

 most powerful criminal organization in Sharn started as a family of 
halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Operating out of its 
headquarters and key holdings in the Little Plains district of Middle 
Menthis, the Boromar Clan controls gambling, smuggling, and theft in 
Sharn. Most of the city's burglars, pickpockets, and fences either work 
for or pay tithes to the organization. The Boromar Clan's network of 
extortion, bribery, and blackmail extends from Lower Dura to Skyway.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="1047">

			</div></div><p></p><p>The Boromars' influence extends beyond criminal
 enterprises into many legitimate circles of power. Ilyra Boromar sits 
on the city council, and a number of other councilors are close allies 
of the clan. The family has ties by marriage to House Jorasco. A Boromar
 attends every Skyway party. The family owns tenements throughout Sharn 
and invests in shipping, storing both legal goods and contraband in many
 of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsgate. In many districts, local 
officials and Sharn Watch officers have been taking bribes from the 
Boromars for generations.</p><p>The criminal nature of the Boromar Clan 
is an open secret, and in some districts the Boromars are seen as 
hometown heroes. They are immigrants who've made good, common people 
who've risen to rival the barons and kings. They give the people what 
they want, whether it's untaxed gambling, cheap spirits, or dreamlily. 
The clan operates with a degree of impunity because its operatives 
adhere to an unspoken rule: whenever possible, criminal acts against 
individuals should target tourists and travelers. Boromar pickpockets 
don't prey on the people they see every day. Instead, they seek out the 
many strangers who move around the city all the time. The Watch officer 
who turns a blind eye to a pickpocket thus feels justified, since it's 
not the citizens of Sharn that are victimized.</p><p>Boromar's 
longstanding status at the head of Sharn's criminal enterprises has 
recently come under challenge. After nearly a decade of slow growth, the
 Droaamish mob known as Daask has recently started targeting Boromar 
holdings. The halfling clan hasn't faced such a serious threat before, 
and it's scrambling to figure out how to deal with Daask's guerrilla 
tactics.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1048" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Boromar Operations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p246</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Boromar Clan has a hand in all types of crime in Sharn. Most Boromar 
leaders despise unnecessary violence, but the clan has a host of 
enforcers and a handful of capable assassins. The clan's web of 
extortion is so thoroughly woven into society that many residents simply
 consider it another form of tax. Boromar specializes in three fields of
 activity: gambling, smuggling, and thievery.</p><p>Gambling isn't 
illegal in Sharn, but all legal games are taxed by the Brelish crown and
 are required to follow regulations that spoil the experience for many. 
Boromar's operations are cheaper to participate in and offer the lure of
 greater profits.</p><p>Smuggling has become an increasingly important 
business since the Last War disrupted many traditional lines of trade. 
The clan's primary import is the narcotic called dreamlily. But the 
Boromars traffic in a wide range of goods, from arcane and alchemical 
weapons to foreign luxury items that have been made scarce by embargoes 
and sanctions. Under Boranel's law, it's forbidden to sell Aundairian 
wine in Breland, so if you want the good stuff, you'll need to work with
 the Boromars.</p><p>Boromar-sanctioned acts of thievery include the 
activities of the ubiquitous pickpockets that can be found across the 
city as well as the well-planned jobs of professional burglars. As 
mentioned earlier, Boromar thieves focus their attention on visitors to 
Sharn, thus avoiding friction with local law enforcement. When 
appropriate, stolen goods are transported out of the city by the fences 
and porters that drive the clan's smuggling operations.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1049" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Boromar Clan NPCs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p246</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Boromar Clan employs people of all races, but most of the organization 
and nearly all of its inner circle are made up of halflings. Some of the
 organization's most important people are these:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Saidan
 Boromar is the current patriarch of the family. He grew up in Lower 
Dura and worked as a thief and assassin there before taking over the 
organization.</li><li class="rd__li ">Mala Boromar d'Jorasco is an heir 
of House Jorasco and the Boromar family matriarch. Her position in the 
family ensures that important members of the Boromar Clan receive 
Jorasco healing services at no cost to them; Saidan reimburses Jorasco 
from the clan's treasury.</li><li class="rd__li ">Councilor Ilyra 
Boromar is the eldest daughter of Mala and Saidan and a member of the 
city council. The Boromars' enemies on the council have grown bolder in 
the face of increased Daask attacks against the clan, and some of 
Ilyra's influence has eroded as a result.</li><li class="rd__li ">Halak 
Boromar is the family's chief enforcer. A recent immigrant from the 
Talenta Plains, Halak leads the Clawfoots, the Boromars' personal guard,
 and is an accomplished warrior.</li><li class="rd__li ">Ilsa Boromar is the family's leader in Callestan. She is ruthless in protecting her family's interests.</li><li class="rd__li ">Castar,
 a gnome, is the lone non-halfling in the Boromars' inner circle. He 
serves as Saidan's chief advisor and the organization's intelligence 
expert. The family looks to Castar to come up with a plan to defeat 
Daask, but so far none of his ideas have worked.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1050" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Shady Nightclub</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p247</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Boromars control gambling dens and nightclubs throughout Sharn. The 
finer establishments are places for the Boromar Clan to wine, dine, 
bribe, and extort the city's powerful elite. At the other end of the 
spectrum, the run-down gambling halls and dreamlily dens in the poorer 
districts are places where those in the employ of the Boromars plan 
heists, store smuggled goods, hide bodies and wanted criminals, 
interrogate Daask spies, make good on threats, and unwind.</p><p>These 
places are public and expertly run by the city's most powerful 
criminals, so an openly violent approach to problem-solving in such a 
spot is likely to end in tragedy for the characters. When combat does 
occur in one of these nightclubs, it's usually because the instigators 
have brought enough strength of arms to take on the Boromars.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1051" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Shady Nightclub Features</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p247</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 nightclub shown on map 4.12 could be tied to the Boromar Clan, or it 
could be any Sharn nightclub you need it to be. Made to accommodate 
customers from halflings to ogres, the club's double doorways are 10 
feet wide, and its ceilings are 15 feet tall. Hooks, shelves, handrails,
 and furniture are provided at three different levels and sizes.</p><p>The
 nightclub has three entrances. Two are connected to the outside: a main
 entrance guarded by a bouncer and a back door that is locked from 
inside. Another locked entrance is connected to a stair that leads up 
and down to other levels in the nightclub's tower.</p><p>The club's main
 entrance opens into an entry vestibule. The attached cloakroom has a 
hidden door that leads to a secret room where criminal meetings and 
illegal activities take place.</p><p>The casino floor in the nightclub 
has tables running games of chance, a bar, and a raised stage. 
Bathrooms, a kitchen, and private rooms for high-roller games (and more 
criminal meetings and illegal activities) are accessible from the casino
 floor.</p><p>Boromar's security and management offices are connected by
 a hallway to the casino floor, the secret meeting room, and a second 
secret area used to store illegal contraband or captives. Occupants of 
both offices can see into these attached areas by way of magic one-way 
mirrors.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="1052">

 by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, Daask has been building its power 
in the Khyber's Gate and Malleon's Gate districts of Sharn for the last 
decade. It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the 
organization also draws members from the destitute populace of 
Sharn—largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any 
other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask 
makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery 
to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, 
building an extortion racket—threatening violence if tribute isn't 
paid—and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a 
mysterious substance called dragon's blood.</p><p>From the outside, 
Daask appears to be interested solely in fomenting violence and chaos. 
The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most 
people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is 
more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren't 
merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora 
Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities 
across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a 
larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a 
foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.</p><p>Over the last two years, the 
Daask cell in Sharn has been waging a slowly escalating war against the 
holdings of the Boromar Clan. The Boromars were surprised by the 
violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask 
prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to
 get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly 
retreating back to their turf. Though the Boromars still control much of

gaining ground in the lower level of the city and controls crime in the

 and intimidation are Daask's most used tools. Rather than using 
bribery, Daask manipulates the Sharn Watch through displays of force and
 brutal reprisals against officers who dare to stand in the way. Coupled
 with the fact that Daask primarily targets businesses with ties to the 
Boromars, this means that many of the Watch officers of the lower wards 
will step aside and allow a Daask raid to run its course.</p><p>As Daask
 has seized territory from the Boromar Clan, it has also begun taking 
over a few of the clan's traditional businesses. In addition to 
dreamlily, Daask sells a highly addictive drug called dragon's blood.</p><p>Daask
 has another, perhaps surprising area of operation: religion. The 
organization has brought priests of the Dark Six to Sharn and has 
restored a ruined temple to the Dark Six in Khyber's Gate. Followers of 
the Dark Six have few other opportunities to practice their faith, and 
providing this new facility for them has made many allies for Daask 
across the city.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1064" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Daask NPCs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p250</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Daask's

 members congregate in safe houses that are hard to find and easy to 
defend or escape from. The most popular gathering location is a Cog hub.
 The dark, twisting halls of these underworld hot spots are familiar to 
Daask members and confusing to their enemies. A Cog hub's tight passages
 have plenty of choke points, forcing one-on-one confrontations in which
 Daask's powerful monsters often have the advantage. Daask also uses Cog
 hubs to stash bodies, drugs, or prisoners.</p><p>Trying to find a Daask
 hub in the Cogs is an adventure in itself. Most members are 
understandably tight-lipped about the location of their meeting and 
hiding places. Once the characters know a hub's location, they still 
must navigate the mazelike Cogs to find the place.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><h2 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1066" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Cog Hub Features</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p250</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>The
 Cog hub shown in map 4.13 could be a Daask location, or it could be any
 Sharn underworld location you need it to be. Several crafted and 
natural labyrinthine passages no more than 10 feet wide lead to the main
 chamber. Many of these passages connect with stairs, ladders, and wells
 that lead higher or lower in the Cogs, in addition to small chambers 
that could be ambush points, temporary quarters for criminals or 
squatters, or places to lay a trap or place an alarm trigger.</p><p>These
 passages converge into a single large chamber that can hold a large 
group for meetings and serve as a temporary safe house or a place to 
stash contraband. When criminals occupy the area, at least one guard is 
always on duty, and typically there is one guard at every entrance to 
the chamber.</p><p>Smaller rooms with heavy iron doors adjoin the 
largest chamber. These rooms can serve as holding cells for captives, 
vaults for valuables, or hiding spots.</p><div class="rd__wrp-gallery"><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class="rd__wrp-gallery-image"><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="1067">

 the surface, Daask appear to be nothing more complicated than a gang of
 violent monsters wreaking havoc in the worst parts of the city. If you 
want, this can be the only role they play in a campaign: a ready source 
of sudden violence. Low-level characters might work with the Sharn Watch
 or the Boromar Clan to curtail Daask muggings and raid dreamlily 
houses. This crusade against Daask will escalate as the adventurers 
become more powerful; Daask will unleash ever more powerful monsters, 
and its forces might start targeting the adventurer's allies and loved 
ones. Those attacks won't end until the adventurers delve deep into the 
Cogs and defeat Cavallah herself.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="1074" data-title-relative-index="0"><h4 class="entry-title-inner">The Sharn Inquisitive—Monstrous Deception</h4> <span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p252</span></span><p>Monsters
 are infiltrating our city! Though the Sharn Watch acts as though Daask 
is a problem only for Malleon's Gate, and not a threat to law-abiding 
citizens, there is clear cunning in the criminal cabal's actions. Their 
recent attacks have targeted properties throughout the lower wards, all 
owned by a certain halfling family, as if Daask were attempting a 
violent takeover of Sharn's underworld. Once these monsters control the 
city's crime, what will they do next?</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>Another
 option is to delve deeper into the motives of Daask, to explore the 
idea that these monsters aren't as savage as they appear. The elite 
members of Daask are spies, soldiers, and saboteurs using their criminal
 activities as a cover for their true agenda. What is Sora Katra really 
trying to accomplish in Sharn? This question ties to how you decide to 
use the Daughters of Sora Kell, described earlier in this chapter. Do 
the Daughters simply want to ravage their enemies? Or, guided by the 
oracular visions of Sora Teraza, are they actually working toward some 
greater good? For instance, Daask agents could break into the vaults and
 workshops of dragonmarked houses and discover secret projects forbidden
 by the Treaty of Thronehold. They could clash with spies of foreign 
powers in Sharn, or pursue ancient artifacts in the ruins below the city
 to keep them out of others' hands.</p><p>Dreamlily is relatively safe; 
dragon's blood is not. Its effects are intentionally unpredictable, and 
you can take this idea wherever you like. Could drinking dragon's blood 
cause someone to develop a dragonmark? Could it turn addicts into 
crazed, draconic creatures? Is Daask simply selling it to make money, or
 is the drug's introduction part of a grander plan? Neither the Boromar 
Clan or the dragonmarked houses have been able to learn anything 
important about dragon's blood.</p><p>Daask can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4">chapter 1</a>.
 The Daask Assignments table provides objectives for adventurers working

 is common knowledge that those with aberrant marks can't be trusted. 
It's not their fault; they're touched by Khyber, and the Dragon Below 
twists their minds. All aberrants will eventually become killers. And 
though I can see the appeal in using these creatures as weapons against 
our enemies, how could we bring such vipers into our midst?</p><p>According
 to a high-ranking source in the King's Citadel, this secret operation 
predictably ended in disaster. After a few missions, the strike force 
slew their handlers and deserted, disappearing into the criminal 
underworld. They could be anywhere. There can be no clearer sign that 
it's time to bring down the monarchy and institute a government that is 
chosen by and answerable to the common people!</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>Long ago, the dragonmarked houses sought to exterminate the bearers of <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,2,aberrant%20dragonmarks,0">aberrant dragonmarks</a>.
 Today, those who carry aberrant dragonmarks are still treated with fear
 and suspicion. During the Last War, the King's Dark Lanterns of Breland
 trained a team of covert operatives who all bore aberrant marks. 
Considered expendable, this group was sent on one suicide mission after 
another. After half its members died in the field, the survivors turned 
on their masters. Six years ago, they fled to Sharn and founded House 
Tarkanan. The group takes its name from Lord Halas Tarkanan, who fought 
the dragonmarked houses long ago and used his aberrant dragonmark to 
destroy Old Sharn.</p><p>The smallest of the four criminal organizations
 described here, House Tarkanan has no interest in claiming territory or
 dominating the criminal underworld. The house takes neither side in the
 war between the Boromar Clan and Daask, and it will not assassinate 
high-ranking members of either organization. In other matters, it sells 
its services to all who have the gold to pay for them. House Tarkanan's 
top priority is using its wealth to protect, train, and care for people 
who have aberrant marks. The leaders of the house are pragmatists and 
soldiers, and they train their recruits to be warriors and thieves.</p><p>Despite
 its name, House Tarkanan is not a dragonmarked house; it has taken the 
name to mock its enemies, and it doesn't have the recognition, power, or
 resources of a dragonmarked house. In fact, many members of House 
Tarkanan hate the dragonmarked houses for being prejudiced against their

Tarkanan from those of House Phiarlan and Thuranni is their 
accessibility. The dragonmarked houses sell their services only to a 
select list of wealthy and powerful clients, and they can pursue 
contracts anywhere in Khorvaire. Conversely, anyone with enough gold can
 hire House Tarkanan's assassins, but they take jobs only within Sharn.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1081" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">House Tarkanan NPCs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p253</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Because

actions could escalate. In addition, you could build a story around 
Thora Tarkanan's quest to discover the secrets of aberrant dragonmarks.

 criminal guild in Sharn is more shrouded in mystery than the Tyrants. 
This organization of changelings deals in secrets and lies, selling 
forgeries, running long cons, and treating identities as a commodity. 
The Tyrants have spies throughout the city, even in places where they 
have no current plans or contracts. The organization gathers as many 
secrets as possible, then sells that information to the highest bidder, 
uses it for blackmail, or stores it for a time when it becomes useful.</p><p>The
 Tyrants have been operating in Sharn for over three hundred years from a
 base of operations in the Dragoneyes district, in Lower Tavick's 
Landing. They have agents spread across the city. A beggar, a bartender,
 or a courtier could actually be a persona crafted by a Tyrant 
changeling. The Tyrants have a long-standing truce with the Boromar Clan
 and don't take a side in the halfling family's conflict with Daask.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1089" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tyrants Operations</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p254</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 Tyrants are master grifters, conducting a host of short and long cons 
throughout the city. Much like the Boromar Clan, they have a general 
live-and-let-live relationship with the Sharn Watch. As long as the 
Tyrants focus their crimes on foreigners and tourists—and donate 
generously to the local Watch—the officers will look the other way. In 
addition to pursuing their own schemes for gold, Tyrant charlatans offer
 a host of services to their clients; they can help to frame innocents 
for crimes, or make it possible for a criminal to seem to be in two 
places at once, providing an ironclad alibi.</p><p>The finest forgers in
 the city are in the ranks of the Tyrants, capable of duplicating 
anything from identification papers to works of art. Magewrights among 
the Tyrants have the ability to permanently alter someone's appearance.</p><p>First
 and foremost, the Tyrants deal in information. They hoard secrets, and 
for the right price they can be persuaded to share what they know. 
Occasionally a Tyrant approaches someone with an offer of information in
 exchange for gold.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1090" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tyrants NPCs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p254</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Members
 of the Tyrants have a loose definition of identity. The majority of the
 members are changelings. They often maintain multiple identities, and a
 particular identity might be shared among a group of changelings. A 
captain in the Sharn Watch who is actually an agent of the Tyrants might
 be portrayed by a member of the Tyrants' inner circle in the morning, 
when he has to interact with a wide range of people. But when he goes 
off-duty in the evening and keeping up the identity is an easier task, 
the role might be taken over by a young recruit.</p><p>The following individuals are some of the Tyrant's most important identities:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Ek, often called Tyrant One, guides the inner circle of changelings that leads the organization.</li><li class="rd__li ">Kilk
 is the city councilor for Lower Tavick's Landing and is a fictional 
persona created by the Tyrants, played by a variety of changelings at 
different times.</li><li class="rd__li ">The Spider is a changeling 
information broker who owns a cosmetics store called Honest Faces in the
 Dragoneyes district. This location is a common destination for people 
who want to purchase secrets from the Tyrants. Though the Spider often 
sells secrets for gold, sometimes it will trade its knowledge only for 
services or other secrets.</li></ul></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1091" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Tyrants Villains</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p255</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 primary theme of the Tyrants is mystery. In dealing with the Tyrants, 
there is always a question of what is real and what the true objective 
actually is. With the Tyrants, anything could be a long con, and both 
allies and enemies may not be who they appear to be.</p><p>The Tyrants 
have three objectives: acquiring gold, gathering secrets, and protecting
 the changelings of Sharn. In working the Tyrants into a campaign, the 
first question is which of these objectives will take precedence. Are 
they primarily grifters, trying to squeeze as much profit as possible 
out of the situation? Are they mainly working to gather secrets, and to 
use those secrets to manipulate others? Or are they most concerned with 
helping other changelings, who are often with the objects of fear and 
suspicion?</p><p>The Tyrants offer an easy way to provide adventurers 
with information. The Spider can be a strong ally for adventurers, and 
you can always arrange for an agent of the Tyrants to step out of the 
shadows with and offer to sell a secret.</p><p>The Tyrants could also 
have a long-term sinister agenda—something they've been working on for 
generations, which is only coming to fruition now. Do they want to 
replace the entire city council of Sharn, or are their aspirations even 
higher than that? In a campaign that examines this idea, the Tyrants 
might impersonate the patrons and allies of the adventurers, thereby 
tricking them into carrying out questionable tasks.</p><p>The Tyrants can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,4">chapter 1</a>,
 especially if the party includes one or more changelings. The Tyrants

 common viewpoint among the citizens of Sharn is that in the upper 
wards, the Sharn Watch works for the wealthy; in the middle wards, it 
works for the Boromar Clan; and in the lower wards, it doesn't work at 
all. This assessment is close enough to the truth. There's an important 
undercurrent in the situation, however. Although most officers of the 
Watch take bribes, that doesn't mean all of them don't care about their 
city and won't try to keep their communities safe; they do so because 
they see their benefactors as being an important part of the continued 
health of their community. For instance, those officers who take gold 
from the Boromar Clan believe that the Boromars help keep the city 
running and give the people what they want. But if some strangers in 
town break the law, they're just troublemakers who deserve to be run in.</p><p>As
 another example, the guards of the Dura Bazaar have an understanding 
with the gang of pickpockets known as the Little Fingers. As long as the
 thieves target only tourists and foreigners, the Watch will dismiss any
 charges brought against them. Why should an officer of the Sharn Watch 
care if some Aundarian with more gold than sense gets robbed? But if the
 Little Fingers pick on a local, they're asking for trouble. The 
relationship works both ways; the pickpockets are privy to things the 
Watch officers aren't, and they often warn the Watch about suspicious 
people or activities they witness.</p><p>Watch officers do exist who are
 entirely crooked and care nothing for the law. At the other extreme, 
some officers are entirely honorable and place the law above all else, 
and most of those are willing to risk their lives to save an innocent 
bystander from a rampaging Daask troll. But most members of the Watch 
are pragmatists who put the needs of their clients uppermost, the needs 
of the citizenry second, and generally don't take action against locals.</p><p>The
 upshot of all this is that the Watch's response to a crime can vary 
significantly depending on the nature of the crime and where it's 
committed. As a rule, when a crime is committed in Skyway, any of the 
upper or middle wards, Lower Central, Lower Tavick's Landing, or 
Precarious, members of the Watch arrive to intervene and investigate as 
soon as possible. In Cliffside, Lower Menthis, and Lower Northedge, the 
few Watch members in these locations address crimes in order of 
priority. In Lower Dura and the Cogs, the Watch's reponse is typically 
very slow.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1098" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sharn Watch Divisions</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p256</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The
 discussion above primarily concerns the rank and file of the Sharn 
Watch, the guards who walk the streets day in and day out and the 
officers who supervise them. The Watch also includes a few special 
divisions that could cross the paths of the adventurers.</p><p><b>The Blackened Book</b>
 is an elite core of abjurers and diviners, charged with investigating 
and containing magical threats. These wizards are highly dedicated to 
their work and their city, and generally don't take bribes. It's up to 
the higher-ups, however, to decide what missions to assign to the 
Blackened Book; if there's a case that a noble doesn't want 
investigated, it probably won't be.</p><p><b>The Guardians of the Gate</b>
 came into being during the Last War to monitor the activities of 
foreign nationals and immigrants. Their duties have expanded since the 
surge of refugees into Sharn following the Mourning, and the Guardians 
of the Gate closely supervise the district of High Walls. The Guardians 
are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to 
their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the city ahead of
 strict adherence to the law, and complaints are raised against them 
from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees.</p><p><b>The Redcloak Battalion</b>
 is an exceptional unit of soldiers that is called upon if a situation 
calls for extreme military force. The Redcloaks are heroes of the Last 
War, and now that the fighting is over most of them don't appreciate 
being used as local police. The Redcloaks are absolutely faithful to 
Breland: they are willing to lay down their lives in the service of 
their nation. Trying to bribe a Redcloak is a good way to lose a hand. 
Like the Blackened Book, however, the Redcloaks are elite troops that 
act only when they're mustered by a captain of the Watch; typically, 
they won't be asked to respond to a situation if it's not in the 
interests of the Boromar Clan. The Redcloak Battalion is described in 
more detail in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,8,the%20redcloak%20battalion,0">chapter 3</a>.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1099" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Sharn Watch NPCs</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p257</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 folk often forget that the Guardians of the Gate have a civilian branch
 that handles administrative issues and special customs investigations. 
Tethyn Olar has led that arm of the Sharn Watch for more than a decade.</p><p>Many
 immigrants owe their safe and comfortable lives in our city to this 
man, but claims have surfaced recently charging him with corruption, 
saying that he took money from immigrants in exchange for a faster path 
into Sharn. Olar has refuted those claims with this statement: "Look at 
the lower wards to see the vast number of poor immigrants the Gate 
allows to enter in the city. Those with wealth tend to be more 
responsible and quicker to put their paperwork together, but none with 
worthy cause to be here are barred."</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>Some of the Sharn Watch's most important people are as follows:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Lord
 Commander Iyan ir'Talan is a male human in charge of the Sharn Watch. 
As long as the city's wealthy elite are content to keep Iyan in power, 
he does little more than maintain the status quo.</li><li class="rd__li ">Commander
 Lian Halamar is a male halfling who leads the garrison in the 
Daggerwatch district in Upper Dura. The Boromar Clan bribes Lian to make
 sure the Watch is away from the scene during their criminal activities.
 The Boromars are pressuring Lian to crack down on Daask, but he has no 
desire to put his officers in danger unnecessarily.</li><li class="rd__li ">Commander
 Belew Yorgan is a male dwarf who leads the Sword Point garrison in 
Middle Central. He does his best to serve the interests of the nobles 
and wealthy patrons in the Central Plateau, and as a result these wards 
are among the safest in Sharn. But Yorgan's loyalties are first and 
foremost to his purse, and the troops under his command serve whoever's 
paying the most.</li><li class="rd__li ">Commander Silaena Cazal is a 
female elf who runs the Warden Towers garrison in Middle Menthis. Over a
 century of service, she has woven a net of graft and extortion across 
Menthis Plateau; she looks after those who pay their dues. Her mother 
was driven from House Phiarlan when she developed an aberrant 
dragonmark. Because of that treatment, Silaena harbors deep resentment 
for the dragonmarked houses and will occasionally take actions to 
inconvenience them. Thora Tavin of House Tarkanan is working to 
strengthen her relationship with Commander Cazal.</li><li class="rd__li ">Commander
 Iyanna ir'Talan is a female human who commands the Black Arch garrison 
in Lower Tavick's Landing. The daughter of the Lord Commander, Iyanna is
 idealistic and honorable. She fights for the good of the common people.
 If the adventurers need an honest ally in the Watch, Iyanna is perhaps 
their best hope. Despite her father's best efforts to keep her from 
getting entangled in the criminal underworld, her actions have won her 
no friends among Sharn's crime lords, and her life could be in danger 
despite her parentage.</li><li class="rd__li ">Lady Warden Maira 
ir'Talan, a distant relative of the Lord Commander, leads the Blackened 
Book. A gifted diviner, Maira is a highly effective leader. What none 
know is that she's also an agent of the Dreaming Dark. Five years ago, a
 <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#kalaraq%20quori_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="kalaraq%20quori_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">kalaraq quori</a> (see <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,13">chapter 6</a>)
 named Tirashana implanted a mind seed in her thoughts. Maira continues 
to do her job while concealing any evidence of the Dreaming Dark's 
schemes.</li><li class="rd__li ">Captain Daja Brel is a female human who
 commands the Guardians of the Gate. Daja firmly believes that the 
Guardians are all that stands between order and chaos in Sharn, and she 
acts with unbridled force if she believes a group or an individual 
threatens the city.</li><li class="rd__li ">Captain Khandan Dol is a 
male dwarf who leads the Redcloak Battalion. Khandan is a local legend 
who served in the Brelish army throughout the Last War; he was knighted 
by the last king of Galifar and swore an oath to the first queen of 
Breland. He enjoys drinking and gambling. He takes discipline seriously,
 though, and expects his soldiers to show complete loyalty to their 
country and its king. Because of his experiences in the war, he has a 
deep dislike for Thranes and followers of the Silver Flame, but he 
rarely lets these feelings interfere with his duties.</li></ul><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1101">Sharn Watch Races</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

 you want to make the Sharn Watch a significant part of the campaign, 
you can develop a story for a particular commander. Lian Halamar is the 
primary agent of the Boromar Clan, and if the adventurers are fighting 
the Clan, any interaction with the Watch can ultimately come to Lian's 
attention, with his corruption slowly becoming more and more evident. If
 the characters oppose House Tarkanan, it could be Commander Cazal who 
keeps interfering with their investigations and placing obstacles in 
their way. Can the adventurers find a way to remove their rival from 
power?</p><p>Another option is to focus a story on Commander Iyanna and 
her efforts to purge corruption from the Watch. A chance encounter could
 bring the two together; perhaps the adventurers are on the scene when 
Iyanna is targeted by assassins. Iyanna could call on the adventurers to
 investigate corruption and to deal with officers who are breaking their
 oaths. How deep are they willing to go?</p><p>If the adventurers do 
form an alliance with a Watch officer, you can use the Sharn Watch 
Assignments table to create adventure hooks for parties and side quests 
for individual characters—cases their ally doesn't trust the Watch 
regulars to handle fairly.</p><table class="w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table"><caption data-title-index="1108">Sharn Watch Assignments</caption><thead><tr><th class="col-2 text-center" data-rd-isroller="true"><span class="roller render-roller" title="Click to roll.

		</div></div><p></p><p><b>Eberron dragonshards</b> are found in shallow
 soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron dragonshards
 can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have 
been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In
 their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson 
swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing 
powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of 
magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in 
place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says 
otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced 
component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some 
magic items, and many powerful tools—such as the lightning rail and 
elemental airships—require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron 
dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</p><p><b>Khyber dragonshards</b>
 are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals
 typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in 
areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep 
blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have
 an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding—which is behind 
airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons—requires a Khyber

 fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the 
world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys 
dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential
 source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in
 color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards 
are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for 
attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the 
creation of legendary items or artifacts.</p></div><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="1114" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Magic Items</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> <span class="rd__title-link ">p275</span><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable" data-rd-h-toggle-button="true">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The

 Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the 
Shadow Marches—reminders of the conflict between the Gatekeepers and the
 daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost.
 It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound

 enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be dire consequences

provides stat blocks for many of the creatures that can play a role in 
an Eberron campaign, including enemies that might overrun a town, 
powerful entities threatening all Khorvaire, and NPCs that can serve as 
either friends or foes.</p><p>The chapter's monsters appear first in a 
bestiary. They're followed by a collection of generic NPCs—various 
people who can populate your Eberron adventures.</p><p>Remember that few
 intelligent creatures in Eberron are inherently evil. Even dragons, 
which on other worlds are associated with certain alignments, choose 
their own paths. The adventure ideas and encounter tables in chapter 4 
offer abundant examples of monsters behaving in ways that aren't 
traditionally monstrous.</p><p></p><div class="float-clear"></div><div class=""><div class="rd__wrp-image relative" data-title-index="1131">

daelkyr-induced madness, or a sorcerer's Sorcerous Origin could be the

 Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen 
spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the
 replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the 
attack bonus from the living spell's Magical Strike.</p><p>For example, if you turn <a href="https://5e.tools/spells.html#fireball_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="spells.html" data-vet-source="PHB" data-vet-hash="fireball_phb" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">fireball</a> (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the <a href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#living%20lightning%20bolt_erlw" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)" data-vet-page="bestiary.html" data-vet-source="ERLW" data-vet-hash="living%20lightning%20bolt_erlw" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">living lightning bolt</a>.
