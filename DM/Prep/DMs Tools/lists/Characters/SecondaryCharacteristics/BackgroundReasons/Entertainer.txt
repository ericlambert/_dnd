Members of my family made ends meet by performing, so it was fitting for me to follow their example.
I always had a keen insight into other people, enough so that I could make them laugh or cry with my stories or songs.
I ran away from home to follow a minstrel troupe.
I saw a bard perform once, and I knew from that moment on what I was born to do.
I earned coin by performing on street corners and eventually made a name for myself.
A traveling entertainer took me in and taught me the trade.
