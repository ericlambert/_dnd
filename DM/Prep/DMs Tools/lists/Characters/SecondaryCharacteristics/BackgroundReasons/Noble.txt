I come from an old and storied family, and it fell to me to preserve the family name.
My family has been disgraced, and I intend to clear our name.
My family recently came by its title, and that elevation thrust us into a new and strange world.
My family has a title, but none of my ancestors have distinguished themselves since we gained it.
My family is filled with remarkable people. I hope to live up to their example.
I hope to increase my familyâ€™s power and influence.
