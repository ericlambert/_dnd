I was naturally curious, so I packed up and went to a university to learn more about the world.
My mentorâ€™s teachings opened my mind to new possibilities in that field of study.
I was always an avid reader, and I learned much about my favorite topic on my own.
I discovered an old library and pored over the texts I found there. That experience awakened a hunger for more knowledge.
I impressed a wizard who told me I was squandering my talents and should seek out an education to take advantage of my gifts.
One of my parents or a relative gave me a basic education that whetted my appetite, and I left home to build on what I had learned.
