Plot twist for Fear the DnD
Finn and Djinn die in Undermountain…

They wake up in a dark room, in the corner of the room is an old dwarf who says “You’ll have to do better than that guys”
 
Their vision goes dark and they pass out.
 
When Finn comes to he is walking up the street to the Yawning Portal… outside he see’s a homeless dwarf sitting on the ground in a huddled pile (Djinn).
 
Time has reset.

The rest of the season takes place as loops through the same series of days. Each loop resolves with some piece of info that the players can use to progress further in resolving.
Try and pace the game to be one loop per session.

All movies and video games from our world also exist in my group's world...as stage plays. (self.DnD)

Characters will remark that this heist reminds them of the the production of Ocean's 11 they saw in the last town, or the DM will describe a horde of goblins as resembling the Grunts in the latest installment of the smash hit Halo! The Combat Musical by Bungie the Playwright Gnome. An orc dismissed Lord of the Rings as minstrel show stereotyping.
It's a fun way to add some culture to a world without coming up with fictional works of art. Our campaign is pretty goofy and it probably wouldn't fit in a more serious story but it's fun for us.

Ronin
A ronin was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period of Japan. A samurai became masterless from the death or fall of his master, or after the loss of his master's favor or privilege.
