Path of the Ancestral Guardian:
SKAUG-00A3D reveres his ancestoral creators (the Netherese) and believes that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits who can guide and protect the living. 

When SKAUG-00A3D rages, he crosses the barrier into the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

SKAUG-00A3D fight to protect his allies with the aid of ancestral guardians. With the spirits’ help, he can hinder foes even as they strike powerful blows against him and his allies.

In order to cement ties to his ancestral guardians, SKAUG-00A3D covers himself in elaborate tattoos that celebrate the deeds of the Netherese. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

::Rage:: 
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On Your Turn, you can enter a rage as a Bonus Action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

	• You have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength saving throws.
	• When you make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.
	• You have Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast Spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked Unconscious or if Your Turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on Your Turn as a Bonus Action.

Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a Long Rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

Available Rages: ____ of 3

::Ancestral Protectors::
Spectral warriors appear when you rage. These warriors distract a foe you designate and hinder its attempts to evade you. 

While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn or until your rage ends, the chosen creature has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you, and if the creature takes the Disengage action within 5 feet of you, its speed is halved until the end of its turn.

::Reckless Attack::
When you make your first attack on your turn, you can do so recklessly. You have advantage on melee attack rolls on this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. 
 
::Extra Attack::
You can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action on you turn.
