Victor will ask: "Where did my friend's end up after they died?"

Ever since the Owlbear killed his friends, Victor has been starting to =
think about the afterlife. Rituals of any kind always seemed like =
superstition to Victor so he hasn't pledges himself to a deity, but his =
friends had and he never thought anything of it... to each his own. =
Victor is wondering if they each made it to their diety's realm.

Alex (Human Fighter): held Kord's Destiny: Baervan Wildwanderer
Connor (Human or Half-Orc (no one knew for sure) Barbarian): Ilmater
Rolen (Elven Archer): Mielikki

Up to you to decide where each of them ended up, but please don't add a =
bunch of detail... I want to flesh that out on my own down the road :-).

Apparently, there's all kinds of stuff that can happen after a person =
dies in Forgotten Realms.

Basically...
You die on the Mortal Plane
You pop up on the "Fugue Plane" which is ruled by Kelemvor from the City =
of Judgement.
If in life you didn't worship a deity then you are considered one of the =
"Faithless". (Victor would fall in this category)
The wall around the City of Judgement is made up of the soulds of the =
Faithless. Souls are bound to it until they dissolve into the wall or =
are stolen by a demon (The Tanar'ri) and taken to the Abyss.
If in life you did worship a deity...
If you betrayed your god, then you are one of "The False" and are =
compelled into the City of Judgement where Kelemvor doles out punishment =
in some way based on your betrayal.
If you were true to your god, then you wander around the Fugue Plane =
(unaware that you are dead) until your deity's representative to come by =
and take you to that god's realm where you serve in some way.
While waiting, you have to contend with demons
The Baatezu (Lawful Evil demons) have a deal worked out with Kelemvor to =
bargain with souls. They can't trick or hurt you but they can try to =
convince you to willingly go to the Nine Hells instead of your god's =
realm. Over time, a soul can grow powerful in The Nine Hells so this may =
seem like a better alternative to some who:
Didn't outright betray their god but still might have displeased them in =
some way and fear punishment when arriving at their realm.
Worshipped an evil god that will torment and/or treat them poorly =
forever no matter what.
The Tanar'ri (Chaotic Evil demons) show up at random and try to steal =
souls.=20
These two factions of demons hate each other so when the Tanar'ri show =
up on the Fugue Plane, the Baatezu will fight them alongside Kelemvor's =
servants.
