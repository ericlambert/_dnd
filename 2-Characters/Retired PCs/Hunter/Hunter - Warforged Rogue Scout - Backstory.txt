I was created by a tinkerer living in a small mountain town. 

The local lord compeled me to enlist in his army. I didnt know how to fight but learned quickly once I was assigned to a squadron. I guess I fell out with one of the guys in the squad. He seemed angry with me all the time but I don't know why. When war did come I suffered minor damage. Some of my shoulder plating is scuffed up to this day. I tried to buff it out but oh well.

My squad occupied a small farming village for a number of years. The villagers didn't seem hostile and we didn't really care to fight. A few years in we really just kind of became a part of the village. But when the war ended one of my squadmates drank too much and did some bad stuff. Blamed it on me. The army found me guilty and I spent 3 years shackled to the oars of a small warship.
