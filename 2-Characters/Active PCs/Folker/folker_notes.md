### Crypt : Sir Spenser

> High above all a cloth of State was spread,
> And a rich throne, as bright as a sunny day,
> On which there sate most brave embellished
> With royal robes and a gorgeous array,
> A maiden Queen, that shone as Titans ray,
> In glistering gold, and peerless precious stone:
> Yet her bright blazing beauty did astray
> To dim the brightness of her glorious throne,
> As envying herself, that to exceeding shone

> The man who invented it,
> Does not want it for himself.
> The man who bought it,
> Does not need it for himself.
> The man who needs it,
> Does not know when he needs it.
