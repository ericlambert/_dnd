<p>Folker stands just over 6ft tall and has a slightly bulky frame. He
has a handsome face with short dark brown hair.</p>
<p>In passing one would not know it but Folker is physically blind and
wears a strip of cloth over his eyes.</p>
<p>He has Blindsight with allows him to “see” as though with normal
eyesight up to 10ft away.</p>
<p>As a result, he generally moves similarly to how a sighted person
moves just a bit more leisurely.</p>
<p>He wears a dark blue cloak over chainmail armor. Leather pants and
tall boots. On his left hip he carries a coiled whip. On the right side
a small hand crossbow.</p>
<p>He is human with a very pale complexion common to those with lineage
tied to the cold landscape of the far northland.</p>
<p>He stands proudly with his head held high as if in thought. This is
because he is usually actively surveying his surroundings using his
non-sight senses.</p>

<h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
<p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Icewind Dale - Ten-Towns - Easthaven;
Home of a healer or midwife (healer) <strong>Family lifestyle:</strong>
Poor (-10) <strong>Childhood Home:</strong> Small house
<strong>Childhood memories:</strong> Folker had a few close friends and
lived an ordinary childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Folker was raised in <strong>Icewind Dale’s
Ten-towns</strong> settlements, specifically the town of
<strong>Easthaven</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/6/64/Easthaven_at_night.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180114174219" alt="Easthaven" title="Easthaven" width="600"/></p>
<p>His mother abandoned him just a few years after his birth then, while
Folker was still quite young, his father <strong>Frank</strong> died
under suspicious circumstances. Folker knows few details about his
parents but has come to understand that his father’s death had something
to do with a criminal endeavor gone wrong.</p>
<p>When Folker’s father died, the man’s closest friends <strong>Marie
and Agni Nicklegem</strong> took Folker in. Even prior to the loss of
his father, he would have called Marie his mother. She is the healer who
oversaw Folker’s birth in the bedroom of their small home and was a
mother figure after Folker’s biological mother left. Though Agni was
absent for most of his childhood, Folker considers the pair to have
raised him and took on the Nicklegem name before leaving home.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/9f/41/179f41bad45cd34f82952f693f12ec03.jpg" alt="Agni" title="Broken Man" width="150"/>

<p>Many years after Folker had grown, Marie confided that taking him in
was not just due to charity and the close relationship she and Agni had
with his father but also as a sense of responsibility for the
circumstances of the man’s death. Marie herself knows no details of that
death but she does know that Agni got the two men mixed up with some
kind of black-market dealing and Folker’s father paid the heavier
price.</p>
<p>Today, in failing health, Agni strikes Folker as a sad, troubled and
broken man who in his “prime” was unable to resist scheming to make a
quick buck. Conversing with Agni today is a confused and foggy affair
until one brings up the topic of money making at which point the man
becomes remarkably cogent. However, Folker cannot deny that whatever
Agni did in the past managed to satisfy his part in raising five
children. Folker is friendly with his adoptive father but that is as far
as it goes. At the back of Folker’s mind has lied the possibility that
Agni’s past may bring the man into conflict with Folker’s Oath.</p>
<p>By the time they took on Folker, Agni and Marie Nicklegem had already
begun raising children of their own. Folker considers them to be his
younger siblings and has a positive relationship with all of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>eldest sister Tove</strong> is just slightly younger than
Folker and was alive when he came to live with the Nicklegems. She left
home about a year after Folker did and trained as a monk. Today she is
an adventurer of some renown around the Ten-Towns and Luskan.

<li><p><strong>brothers Meilin and Jun</strong> were both born after
Folker’s father died and just a year apart. Both moved south from
Icewind Dale to herd sheep in the countryside outside of Neverwinter.
From what Folker has gathered, the older Meilin has a questionable
reputation with the locals there but the younger Jun seems to keep him
from straying too far from respectability.

<li><p><strong>youngest sister Elektra</strong> was born after Folker
had left home to train as a paladin, so he has less of a relationship
with her but Folker does know that after some trouble as adolescent she
became a priest and has stayed close to home, helping Marie care for
Agni and caring for both of them as they age.

<h3 id="young-adulthood">Young Adulthood</h3>
<h4 id="witness-to-evil">Witness to Evil</h4>
<p>When Folker was young Rudolph van Richten, the famous monster hunter,
stayed in Easthaven for a few months while on the trail of a vampire he
believe had fled the cities of the southern Sword Coast to the cold and
darkness of Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>Van Richten’s search culminated in a terrifying battle in the heart
of the town between himself, the vampire and it’s minions. van Richten,
of course, won out in the end however multiple critical structures in
Easthaven were in ruins.</p>
<p><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/icewind-dale/images/6/6f/AR1000_Easthaven.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20191027152015"/></p>
<p>At one point a cloud of bats descended on Folker and his brothers as
they hid behind a traveller’s wagon some distance from the fighting. The
older and stronger Folker carried his younger brothers to safety as they
covered their faces from the claws and biting of the bats. Folker, eyes
open took multiple slashes and bites to his head and upper body in the
process. The wounds were superficial and within Marie’s skill to heal
with the exception of those inflicted to Folker’s eyes, which he would
never regain the use of. Though Folker had been physically blinded by
the bats, curiously he suffered no disease as a result of the attack.
Something unseen in all of the many other cases of bat attacks that had
been inflicted on the locals of Easthaven in the weeks leading up to van
Richten’s final confrontation.</p>
<p>In the end, the destruction his quest had wrought on the town seemed
invisible to van Richten who appeared content to call the another
monsterslaying successful before he moved on from Easthaven. As he did
many who called Easthaven home laid in recovery some of whom did not
make it.</p>
<p>A few days into his own recovery, Folker miraculously woke with a
strange new sensation. He was once again aware of his immediate
surroundings just as though he could see them. But it was not sight in
the way he had known it. Marie would explain it as blindsight, a
condition she had heard of before but never witnessed.</p>
<h5
id="folker-recanted-these-events-in-this-way-during-session-1">Folker
recanted these events in this way during Session 1</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>I tell you… vampires are very real.</p>
<p>In the far north of the Sword Coast lies the Icewind Dale settlements
of the Ten Towns. Easthaven is one of the larger of them.</p>
<p>Once a vile unnatural evil came to Easthaven and on it’s heels a
great monster hunter. The hunter stayed in Easthaven for weeks, enjoying
the respect and awe of the townsfolk while he searched for his quarry.
The hunter believed the vampire to be finally fleeing trouble in the
lower cities of the Sword Coast and recanted many tales of his
encounters with the creature over them years.</p>
<p>Eventually the hunter and the vampire battled openly in the streets
of Easthaven. The hunter vanquished the evil, but not before ravaging
the town. Many homes crumbled, many lives were lost.</p>
<p>When the hunter left, the townsfolk put the pieces back together and
mourned their lost.</p>
<p>To this day all in Easthaven spit at the mention of vampires but the
town is divided in how they think of the hunter. Some claim his
departure was filled with a prideful, callousness that ignored the
destruction his quest brought upon the town. He even scoffed at being
asked to pay his inn tab… some say.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="youre-a-paladin-folker">You’re a paladin Folker</h4>
<p>As part of the recovery effort, a paladin named Nausikaa journeyed to
Easthaven. Hearing of the Folker’s acts of bravery and of the blindsight
the boy had been endowed with, she sought Folker out. After meeting him,
Nausikaa saw great potential in Folker and believed the blindsight to be
a blessing that Helm bestowed on him in return for the virtue and
bravery the boy had shown in protecting his brothers.</p>
<p><strong>Nausikaa Soleil</strong>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/d6/3d/83d63d9028c0f4bed3658a158800becc.jpg" alt="Nausikaa" title="Female Paladin" width="300"/>
Name: Nausikaa Soleil Gender: Female Race: Human Alignment: Neutral
Class: Paladin - Oath of Redemption Relationship: Friendly (Mentor)
Status: Alive and quite successful</p>
<p>She convinced Marie to let her take Folker on as her squire. As such
Folker journeyed with Nausikaa to <a
href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Helm%27s_Hold">Helm’s
Hold</a> south east of Neverwinter where Nausikaa trained him in the
ways of a paladin for the remainder of his youth.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="early-adventures">Early Adventures</h3>
<p>Not long after his initial training with Nausikaa Soleil, Folker
struck out on his own wandering the Sword Coast seeking to use his
divine powers to aid and protect lost souls in need of redemption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Session 0 established that Folker considers this to have been a time
of “Monster Hunting”. He claims to have fought werewolves among other
creatures. Although he was unaware of the weakness to silver that all
werewolves share so his claim is considered unreliable by the party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not long after that he strayed from the light.</p>
<h4 id="the-gambler">The Gambler</h4>
<p>In the ruined and declining city of Luskan, while living in destitude
and extreme suffering amongst the warehouses of the Northern Bank,
Folker miraculously gathered winnings from a dice game that could last a
lifetime. As he saw it (and still believes) Tymora blessed him that day.
He began gambling seriously after that. Folker began spendining much of
his time at <a
href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clearlight">Clearlight</a>,
Luskan’s run down temple to Tymora, though it would be a long time
before Tymora would bless him in the same way again.</p>
<p>Eventually Folker became indebted to a powerful yet benevolent crime
boss named The Quillsharpener. Through his organization, <a
href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Coin_Spinners">The Coin
Spinners</a>, The Quillsharpener allowed Folker to work off his debts by
performing various innocuous tasks around town.</p>
<p>Folker began to attribute more and more of his divine powers to the
goddess Tymora and even the god of lies Cyric who had at times blessed
him in games of cards and aided him in his tasks for The Quillsharpener.
Helm, it appeared, had turned his favor elsewhere but Folker’s powers
remained so he barely noticed the shift in thier source.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Folker happened across Nausikaa, the paladin mentor
from his youth, that it became apparent to Folker what had happened. The
stark contrast between he and her, the sadness in her gaze as she took
in who Folker had become. She looked at him the way she looked at the
souls she had worked to redeem while he trained under her all those
years ago. It took only that look from Nausikaa for the reality of The
Quillsharpener’s game to suddenly become clear. One hard look to reveal
the depth of Cyric’s blessings which had allowed Folker to deceive
himself into a life far from the that which he had intended.</p>
<p>As he thought back on his recent jobs, he could no longer miss the
fear and desperation in voices of those he collected “taxes” from for
The Coin Spinners. When, at The Quillsharpener’s behest, he helped yet
another shopkeeper clean up and replace a broken shop window (for a fee
to be collected later of course), he now understood why there was a
thinly hidden note of disdain to the frustration in the shopkeeper’s
voice. He understood too the sneering looks he got from those among The
Quillsharpener’s ranks when they issued his orders for the day, not to
mention the spiteful laughs he heard after he turned his back to leave
the room.</p>
<p>Folker was humiliated and angry.</p>
<p>He began to plot the end of The Quillsharpener’s hold on the
neighborhood around him. The goal was simple, he would climb the ranks
of The Coin Spinners and, when the time was right, behead it. The gifts
of Tymora and Cyric would help him in this quest. And so he did just
that.</p>
<p>And when he stood before The Quillsharpener’s empty “throne”, Folker
realized the vengeance he had found was not that of the neighborhood
around him, but his own… no more, no less. With this realization Folker
once again felt the blessing of Helm, the protector. He would not assume
the Quillsharpener’s power himself but instead called forth the people
of the neighborhood to decide how best to use it.</p>
<p>There were of course some remnants of The Coin Spinners who sought to
‘fill the power vacuum’ and take up the mantle of The Quillsharpener and
revive the criminal undertaking before a new order could be
established.</p>
<p>They were smited.</p>
<p>Before long the neighborhood was in the hands of good honest folk who
trusted each other. Folker’s next chapter awaited him.</p>

<h4 id="an-oath-taken">An Oath Taken</h4>
<p>On the morning before our campaign starts, Folker quietly swore his
Oath of Vengeance at <a
href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plinth">The Plinth</a>,
which prior to the Spellplague in 1385 DR was a tall floating tower
located in Waterdeep midway between the Way of the Dragon and The High
Road south of where the two roads cross in the Trade’s Ward. The Plinth
was dedicated to the worship of any or all deities and administered by
city officials. Today, over 100 years later, The Plinth stands as
overgrown ruins which occupy a single city block and only recently have
begun being restored by the city for use for the same purpose, albeit
much more humbly.</p>
<p>Filled with purpose, Folker made his way back to Trollskull Manor,
the inn where he and his traveling companions had taken up residence for
the past few days.</p>

<h4 id="folkers-oath-of-vengeance">Folker’s Oath of Vengeance</h4>
<p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have
committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers,
when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a
thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages
through the countryside - at times like these, paladins arise and swear
an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these
paladins—sometimes called avengers or dark knights—their own purity is
not as important as delivering justice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>From this time forward I solemnly pledge, to punish mercilessly
any who, through their dark pursuits of power or everlasting, unnatural
life, have wantonly visited pain and destruction, upon the
innocent.</em></p>
<p><em>I further pledge to protect and aid, those harmed by these
villains. For the ruin they suffer, I failed to prevent.</em></p>
<p><em>I pledge these actions even at the loss, of my own righteousness.
For nothing shall be saved, in the face of these evils.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Oath of Vengeance carries with it the following brutally simple
tenets.</p>
<p><strong>Fight the Greater Evil.</strong> Faced with a choice of
fighting my sworn foe(s) or combating a lesser evil, I choose the
greater evil. <strong>No Mercy for the Wicked.</strong> Ordinary foes
might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not. <strong>By Any Means
Necessary.</strong> My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my
foes. <strong>Restitution.</strong> If my foes wreak ruin on the world,
it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their
misdeeds.</p>
<h3 id="beliefs">Beliefs</h3>
<p>To Folker, his devotion to his Oath is a much higher priority than
his faith in any of the gods directly. Higher still than his own
righteousness. It might be fair to say his Oath is his only true God
though, it does not manifest and carries no personification like the
Gods of the realms do. He believes his divine powers have been bestowed
by some of the gods because the impact of his actions to further the
will of those gods not because of a faith in those gods.</p>
<p>Now that he has sworn it, as long as he stays true to his Oath he
will be able to draw on those powers.</p>
<p>Despite having no driving faith in an particular God of the realms,
Folker does possess powers that he considers to be divine blessings.
Since those powers are not the result of faith they must be the result
of his actions, he reasons. He prays most often to the gods of the
realms who would be most likely to value his past deeds and his
intentions for future deeds. Those deities are; <strong>Helm</strong> -
god of protection; <em>staring eye on upright left gauntlet</em>
<strong>Cyric</strong> - god of lies; <em>white jawless skull on black
or purple sunburst</em> <strong>Tymora</strong> - goddess of good
fortune; <em>face-up coin</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Folker generally lives a life in squalor (1SP/day). He seeks out
lodging in the rough parts of town because it is there that he is most
likely to find those wronged by the evil deeds of others. His immunity
to disease makes it a bit safer to live in this setting as well.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="secrets">Secrets</h2>
<p>Folker’s believes that his Oath necessitates that he smite not only
vampires but Rudolph van Richten as well. For the famous monster hunter
was equally complicit in the destruction of Easthaven and the suffering
it inflicted. He not will not tell people this. In fact, he will
actively lie to hide it. van Richten is beloved and hailed as a hero. If
he is to succeed in punishing the monster hunter, Folker best keep his
intentions to do so a secret.</p>
